# Agent Handoff Document - Funlynk Platform Development

## Project Overview

**Funlynk** is a comprehensive social activity marketplace platform that connects people through shared experiences. Think of it as a combination of Meetup, Eventbrite, and social networking, with integrated payments and community features.

### Platform Vision
- **Social Activity Discovery**: Users find and join activities based on interests and location
- **Host Monetization**: Activity hosts can earn revenue through paid experiences
- **Community Building**: Social features foster connections and recurring engagement
- **Marketplace Dynamics**: Transparent revenue sharing between platform and hosts

## Current Project Status

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Epic Planning Phase (27 hours)**
We have successfully completed comprehensive architectural planning for the entire platform:

- **7 Major Epics** fully planned and documented
- **35 Planning Documents** with detailed specifications
- **Complete Platform Architecture** ready for implementation
- **Database Schemas** designed for all features
- **API Contracts** specified for all services
- **Integration Points** mapped across all components

### 🔄 **IN PROGRESS: Task Creation Phase**
We've begun breaking down epics into implementable tasks:

- **Task Framework** established with enhanced templates
- **2 Complete Tasks** created as examples (Database Foundation)
- **~100+ Tasks** still needed across all features
- **Implementation Strategy** defined with clear priorities

### ⏳ **NEXT: Complete Task Breakdown**
The immediate next phase is to continue creating detailed tasks for all features.

## Our Planning Philosophy

### 1. **Complete Upfront Planning**
We chose comprehensive upfront planning over iterative discovery because:
- AI agents work better with complete context
- Prevents architectural debt and rework
- Enables parallel development across teams
- Reduces integration complexity

### 2. **Epic → Feature → Task Hierarchy**
- **Epics**: Major platform capabilities (7 total)
- **Features**: Cohesive user-facing functionality (3-5 per epic)
- **Tasks**: Granular implementation work (1-4 hours each)

### 3. **Enhanced Task Templates**
Each task follows a 4-phase structure:
- **Problem Definition**: Clear scope and acceptance criteria
- **Research**: Technical decisions and analysis
- **Enhanced Planning**: UX/Backend/Frontend/Third-party specifications
- **Implementation Tracking**: Detailed progress monitoring

### 4. **Quality Standards**
- Tasks must be implementable in 1-4 hours by experienced developer
- Complete documentation for reproducibility
- Clear dependencies and blocking relationships
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria

## Implementation Priority Strategy

- **Complete documentation** enabling independent development

## Questions for New Agent

When you begin, consider these questions:
1. Do you understand the epic → feature → task hierarchy?
2. Are you clear on the 4-phase task template structure?
3. Do you have access to all the epic planning documents?
4. Are the implementation priorities and dependencies clear?
5. Do you need clarification on any architectural decisions?
