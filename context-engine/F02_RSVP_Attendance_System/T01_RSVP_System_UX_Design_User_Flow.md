# T01 RSVP System UX Design & User Flow

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Design the complete user experience for RSVP and attendance workflows, including participant registration, capacity management, waitlist handling, and check-in processes. This includes creating intuitive interfaces that work seamlessly for both participants and hosts.

### Problem Statement
Users need streamlined RSVP experiences that:
- **Enable quick registration**: Allow participants to join activities with minimal friction
- **Provide clear status**: Show capacity, waitlist position, and registration status
- **Handle edge cases**: Manage full activities, cancellations, and waitlist promotions
- **Support hosts**: Give hosts tools to manage participants effectively
- **Ensure reliability**: Handle high-demand activities and concurrent registrations

The RSVP system must balance simplicity with comprehensive functionality for various activity types.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- RSVP registration flow with capacity awareness
- Waitlist management and position tracking
- Attendance check-in interface design
- Host participant management tools
- Real-time capacity updates and notifications
- RSVP status management (confirmed, waitlisted, cancelled)
- Mobile-first responsive design following Funlynk style guide

**Out of Scope:**
- Payment processing for paid activities (handled by E06)
- Advanced analytics dashboards (handled by E07)
- Social features integration (handled by E05)
- Complex approval workflows (handled by E07)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] RSVP flow achieves 95%+ completion rate
- [ ] Waitlist management provides clear status and expectations
