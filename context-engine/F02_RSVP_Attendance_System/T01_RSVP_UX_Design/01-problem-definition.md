# T01 RSVP System UX Design & User Flow - Problem Definition

## Task Overview

**Task ID**: E03.F02.T01  
**Task Name**: RSVP System UX Design & User Flow  
**Feature**: F02 RSVP & Attendance System  
**Epic**: E03 Activity Management  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Priority**: High (Blocks T03 Frontend Implementation)

## Problem Statement

Users need a seamless, intuitive experience for discovering activities and registering their attendance (RSVP). The RSVP system must handle complex scenarios including capacity limits, waitlists, guest management, and real-time updates while maintaining a simple, mobile-first user experience.

The design must accommodate both simple free activities and complex paid events, while providing clear feedback about capacity status, waitlist position, and registration confirmation.

## Context & Background

### User Research Insights
- **Primary Users**: Activity seekers (ages 18-35) looking for spontaneous activities
- **Usage Context**: Often browsing and RSVPing on-the-go via mobile
- **Decision Speed**: Users decide to join activities within 30 seconds of viewing
- **Social Factors**: 60% of users RSVP with friends or bring guests
- **Anxiety Points**: Uncertainty about capacity, waitlist position, and confirmation status

### Business Requirements
- **Conversion Optimization**: Maximize RSVP completion rates
- **Capacity Management**: Prevent overbooking while maximizing attendance
- **Real-time Updates**: Show live capacity and waitlist status
- **Social Features**: Support guest RSVPs and group attendance
- **Host Tools**: Provide hosts with participant management capabilities

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Goals
- [ ] **RSVP Conversion**: 80%+ of users who view activities complete RSVP
- [ ] **Speed**: Average RSVP completion time under 15 seconds
- [ ] **Clarity**: 95%+ of users understand their RSVP status immediately
- [ ] **Error Rate**: Less than 2% of RSVP attempts fail due to UX issues
- [ ] **Satisfaction**: 4.5+ stars for RSVP experience

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **One-Tap RSVP**: Simple RSVP for free activities without additional steps
- [ ] **Capacity Awareness**: Clear indication of available spots and waitlist status
- [ ] **Guest Management**: Easy addition of guests with capacity consideration
- [ ] **Status Clarity**: Unambiguous confirmation, waitlist, or cancellation states
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Live capacity updates without page refresh

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Full compatibility with screen reading software
- [ ] **Color Blind**: Status indication doesn't rely solely on color
- [ ] **Motor Impairment**: Large touch targets and gesture alternatives
- [ ] **Cognitive**: Simple language and clear visual hierarchy

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core RSVP Flow
1. **Activity Discovery** - User finds interesting activity
2. **Capacity Check** - Clear indication of availability
3. **RSVP Action** - One-tap RSVP or guest selection
4. **Confirmation** - Immediate feedback on RSVP status
5. **Management** - Easy access to modify or cancel RSVP

### RSVP States & Feedback
- **Available Spots**: "Join Activity" with spot count
- **Limited Spots**: "Join Activity (3 spots left)" with urgency
- **Waitlist**: "Join Waitlist (Position #5)" with clear expectations
- **Full**: "Activity Full" with waitlist option
- **Confirmed**: "You're Going!" with activity details
- **Waitlisted**: "You're #3 on the waitlist" with promotion expectations

### Guest Management
- **Guest Selection**: Easy +/- controls for guest count
- **Capacity Impact**: Show how guests affect availability
- **Guest Information**: Optional guest details for host planning
- **Group RSVP**: Handle multiple people RSVPing together

### Error Scenarios
- **Capacity Race**: Handle simultaneous RSVPs gracefully
- **Network Issues**: Offline RSVP queuing and sync
- **Payment Required**: Clear transition to payment flow
- **Activity Changes**: Handle activity updates during RSVP

## Out of Scope

### Excluded from This Task
- Backend API implementation (covered in T02)
- Frontend component development (covered in T03)
- Waitlist management logic (covered in T04)
- Attendance tracking interface (covered in T05)
- Host management tools (covered in T06)

### Future Considerations
- Advanced group coordination features
- Social RSVP sharing and invitations
- AI-powered RSVP recommendations
- Integration with external calendar systems

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Tasks
- **F01.T01**: Activity creation UX for consistent design patterns
- **E02.F01.T01**: User profile UX for user context

### Dependent Tasks
- **T03**: Frontend implementation depends on UX specifications
- **T05**: Attendance UX builds on RSVP patterns
- **T06**: Host management UX extends RSVP workflows

### External Dependencies
- Funlynk design system and component library
- User research data and usability testing results
- Competitive analysis of RSVP systems
- Accessibility guidelines and testing tools

## Technical Specifications

### RSVP Component Architecture
```
ActivityCard
â”œâ”€â”€ ActivityInfo
â”œâ”€â”€ CapacityIndicator
â”œâ”€â”€ RSVPButton
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AvailableState
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WaitlistState
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FullState
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ConfirmedState
â”œâ”€â”€ GuestSelector (optional)
â””â”€â”€ RSVPStatus
```

### State Management Requirements
```typescript
interface RSVPState {
  // Activity context
  activityId: string;
  capacity: number | null;
  currentRSVPs: number;
  waitlistCount: number;
  
  // User RSVP status
  userRSVP: RSVP | null;
  waitlistPosition: number | null;
  
  // UI state
  isRSVPing: boolean;
  showGuestSelector: boolean;
  guestCount: number;
  
  // Actions
  createRSVP: (guestCount?: number) => Promise<void>;
  cancelRSVP: () => Promise<void>;
  updateGuestCount: (count: number) => void;
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Capacity Race Conditions**: Multiple users RSVPing simultaneously
- **Real-time Complexity**: Keeping capacity status accurate across all clients

### Medium Risk
- **Guest Management**: Balancing simplicity with guest functionality
- **Error Communication**: Clearly explaining capacity and waitlist concepts

### Low Risk
- **Basic RSVP Flow**: Standard interaction patterns with proven UX
- **Design Consistency**: Building on established Funlynk design system

## User Journey Mapping

### Happy Path: Successful RSVP
```
Activity Discovery â†’ Capacity Check â†’ RSVP Action â†’ 
Confirmation â†’ Activity Participation
```

### Alternative Path: Waitlist RSVP
```
Activity Discovery â†’ Full Capacity â†’ Waitlist Join â†’ 
Waitlist Confirmation â†’ Potential Promotion â†’ Activity Participation
```

### Error Path: RSVP Failure
```
Activity Discovery â†’ RSVP Attempt â†’ Error State â†’ 
Error Recovery â†’ Successful RSVP or Alternative Action
```
