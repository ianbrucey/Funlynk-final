# T02 RSVP Backend APIs & Concurrency Management - Problem Definition

## Task Overview

**Task ID**: E03.F02.T02  
**Task Name**: RSVP Backend APIs & Concurrency Management  
**Feature**: F02 RSVP & Attendance System  
**Epic**: E03 Activity Management  
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: High (Critical backend functionality)

## Problem Statement

The platform needs robust backend APIs to handle RSVP operations with proper concurrency control to prevent overbooking. The system must handle race conditions when multiple users RSVP simultaneously to popular activities while maintaining data consistency and providing real-time updates.

## Context & Background

### Technical Challenges
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple simultaneous RSVPs to limited capacity activities
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining accurate capacity counts across all operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Broadcasting capacity changes to all connected clients
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms response times under high load
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent RSVP operations

### Business Requirements
- **Zero Overbooking**: Strict capacity enforcement with proper locking
- **Waitlist Management**: Automatic promotion when spots become available
- **Guest Handling**: Support for group RSVPs with capacity consideration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all RSVP operations for debugging

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **RSVP Creation**: Handle RSVP with capacity checking and waitlist management
- [ ] **RSVP Cancellation**: Cancel RSVPs with automatic waitlist promotion
- [ ] **Capacity Management**: Real-time capacity tracking with race condition prevention
- [ ] **Waitlist Operations**: Automatic promotion and position management
- [ ] **Guest Management**: Support group RSVPs with proper capacity calculation
- [ ] **Real-time Broadcasting**: Live updates to all connected clients

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Response Time**: 95% of operations complete within 500ms
- [ ] **Concurrency**: Handle 1000+ simultaneous RSVP attempts
- [ ] **Consistency**: Zero overbooking incidents under any load
- [ ] **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful error handling

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/rsvps` - Create RSVP with capacity checking
- `DELETE /api/v1/rsvps/{id}` - Cancel RSVP with waitlist promotion
- `GET /api/v1/rsvps/user/{userId}` - Get user's RSVP history
- `GET /api/v1/activities/{id}/participants` - Get activity participants (host only)
- `POST /api/v1/activities/{id}/capacity/check` - Check current capacity status

## Acceptance Criteria

### Concurrency Control Implementation
- Database row-level locking for capacity management
- Optimistic concurrency control with retry mechanisms
- Transaction isolation to prevent race conditions
- Deadlock detection and resolution

### Business Logic
- Capacity validation before RSVP confirmation
- Automatic waitlist management and promotion
- Guest count validation and capacity calculation
- RSVP status transitions with proper notifications
