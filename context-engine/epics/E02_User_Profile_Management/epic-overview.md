# E02 User & Profile Management - Epic Overview

## Epic Purpose

The User & Profile Management epic builds on Core Infrastructure to provide comprehensive user identity management and social networking capabilities. This epic enables users to create rich profiles, discover and connect with other users, and build their social network within the Funlynk platform.

## Epic Scope

### In Scope
- **Profile Service**: Complete user profile management beyond basic authentication
- **Social Graph Service**: Follower/following relationships and social discovery
- **User Discovery**: Finding and connecting with other users
- **Profile Privacy**: User-controlled visibility and privacy settings

### Out of Scope
- Basic authentication (handled by E01 Core Infrastructure)
- Activity-related user interactions (handled by E03 Activity Management)
- Payment-related user data (handled by E06 Payments & Monetization)

## Component Breakdown

### 2.1 Profile Service
**Purpose**: Manages comprehensive user profile data and preferences beyond authentication
**Responsibilities**:
- User profile CRUD operations (bio, interests, location, images)
- Profile image upload and management
- User preferences and settings
- Profile privacy controls
- User verification and badges
- Profile completion tracking

**Key Features**:
- Rich user profiles with bio, interests, and location
- Profile image upload with automatic resizing
- Interest tagging system for activity matching
- Location-based profile discovery
- Privacy controls (public, friends only, private)
- Profile verification system for trusted users

### 2.2 Social Graph Service (Followers)
**Purpose**: Manages the social connections and relationships between users
**Responsibilities**:
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Follower and following list management
- Social graph analytics and insights
- Follow recommendation engine
- Social privacy controls
- Mutual connection detection

**Key Features**:
- Asymmetric follow model (like Instagram/Twitter)
- Follow recommendations based on mutual connections
- Follow notifications and activity feeds
- Social graph privacy controls
- Follower/following count management
- Block and report functionality

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **E01 Core Infrastructure**: Authentication, database schema, notifications
- **Supabase Storage**: Profile image storage and CDN
- **Image Processing**: Automatic image resizing and optimization

### Internal Dependencies
- **Users table**: Core user data from E01
- **Follows table**: Social graph relationships from E01
- **Notifications service**: Follow notifications from E01

## Success Criteria

### Profile Service
- [ ] Users can create and update comprehensive profiles
- [ ] Profile images upload and display correctly across all devices
- [ ] Interest tagging enables accurate activity recommendations
- [ ] Location data supports discovery while respecting privacy
- [ ] Profile privacy controls work as expected
- [ ] Profile completion encourages user engagement

### Social Graph Service
- [ ] Follow/unfollow operations are instant and reliable
- [ ] Follower counts update accurately in real-time
- [ ] Follow recommendations are relevant and engaging
- [ ] Social graph supports activity discovery and feeds
- [ ] Privacy controls protect user relationships
- [ ] Block functionality prevents unwanted interactions

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Profile operations complete under 200ms
- [ ] Image uploads process and resize within 5 seconds
- [ ] Social graph queries scale to 10,000+ connections per user
- [ ] Follow operations handle concurrent requests correctly
- [ ] Privacy settings are enforced consistently across all features

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Profile creation flow is intuitive and engaging
- [ ] Image upload provides clear progress and error feedback
- [ ] Follow recommendations feel relevant and valuable
- [ ] Social graph operations provide immediate visual feedback
- [ ] Privacy controls are easy to understand and configure

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Profile data integrates seamlessly with activity features
- [ ] Social graph supports feed generation and discovery
- [ ] Follow relationships enable activity recommendations
- [ ] User profiles enhance activity host credibility

## Key Design Decisions

### Profile Data Model
- **Rich Profiles**: Support for bio, interests, location, and multiple images
- **Interest System**: Tag-based interests that connect to activity categories
- **Location Privacy**: Granular control over location sharing (exact, city, hidden)
- **Profile Completion**: Gamified profile completion to encourage engagement

### Social Graph Model
- **Asymmetric Follows**: One-way relationships like Instagram/Twitter
- **No Friend Requests**: Reduces friction and encourages discovery
- **Public by Default**: Follows are public unless user opts for privacy
- **Mutual Connections**: Special handling for users who follow each other

### Privacy Architecture
- **Granular Controls**: Separate privacy settings for different profile elements
- **Default Privacy**: Sensible defaults that protect users while enabling discovery
- **Privacy Inheritance**: Activity privacy can inherit from profile privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Track privacy setting changes for user transparency

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Privacy Violations**: Incorrect privacy enforcement could expose user data
- **Social Graph Performance**: Large follower counts could impact query performance

### Medium Risk
- **Image Storage Costs**: Profile images could become expensive at scale
- **Follow Spam**: Users could abuse follow functionality for spam

### Low Risk
- **Profile Completion**: Users might skip profile setup, reducing engagement

## Performance Considerations

### Profile Service Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic resizing and compression for fast loading
- **Profile Caching**: Cache frequently accessed profiles for 15 minutes
- **Lazy Loading**: Load profile images progressively for better UX

### Social Graph Performance
- **Follower Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large follower lists
- **Follow Caching**: Cache follow status for active users
- **Batch Operations**: Optimize bulk follow operations for recommendations

## Security Considerations

### Profile Security
- **Image Validation**: Strict validation of uploaded images for security
- **Content Moderation**: Automated and manual review of profile content
- **Privacy Enforcement**: Consistent privacy controls across all profile access

### Social Graph Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent follow spam and abuse
- **Block Functionality**: Allow users to block unwanted followers
- **Report System**: Enable reporting of inappropriate profiles or behavior

## Integration with Other Epics

### E03 Activity Management
- Profile data enhances activity host credibility
- Social graph enables activity recommendations
- Interest matching connects users to relevant activities

### E04 Discovery Engine
- Profile data powers user-based recommendations
- Social graph influences activity feed generation
- Interest data improves search and filtering

### E05 Social Interaction
- Profile data provides context for comments and interactions
- Social graph determines interaction visibility and permissions

### E06 Payments & Monetization
- Profile verification affects payment capabilities
- Host profiles build trust for paid activities

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Review**: Validate user and follows table design from E01
2. **Service Architecture**: Define profile and social graph service boundaries
3. **API Contracts**: Specify interfaces for profile and social operations
4. **Integration Points**: Plan integration with activity and discovery features
