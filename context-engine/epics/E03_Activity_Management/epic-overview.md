## Key Design Decisions

### Activity Data Model
- **Rich Metadata**: Support for detailed activity information including requirements, equipment, skill level
- **Flexible Scheduling**: One-time events, recurring activities, and multi-session programs
- **Location Flexibility**: Physical locations, virtual activities, and hybrid events
- **Capacity Management**: Hard limits, soft limits, and unlimited capacity options

### Tagging Architecture
- **Hybrid System**: Predefined categories + user-generated tags for flexibility
- **Tag Normalization**: Automatic synonym detection and tag merging
- **Moderation Pipeline**: Automated filtering + human review for inappropriate tags
- **Trending Algorithm**: Tag popularity based on usage, engagement, and recency

### RSVP System Design
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Handle race conditions for popular activities
- **Flexible Requirements**: Support for questions, waivers, and conditional RSVPs
- **Waitlist Intelligence**: Smart promotion based on user preferences and activity fit
- **Attendance Verification**: Multiple methods (QR, location, manual) for different activity types

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Race Conditions**: Popular activities could have RSVP conflicts during high traffic
- **Data Consistency**: Activity updates must propagate correctly to all participants

### Medium Risk
- **Image Storage Costs**: Activity images could become expensive at scale
- **Tag Spam**: User-generated tags could be abused for spam or inappropriate content
- **Capacity Management**: Complex waitlist logic could confuse users

### Low Risk
- **Geocoding Limits**: External geocoding APIs could hit rate limits
- **Activity Templates**: Templates might not cover all use cases

## Performance Considerations

### Activity Service Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic resizing and compression for fast loading
- **Activity Caching**: Cache popular activities for improved response times
- **Search Indexing**: Optimize activity search with proper database indexes

### RSVP Service Performance

- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient WebSocket updates for capacity changes
- **Batch Operations**: Optimize bulk RSVP operations for large activities

### Tagging Performance
- **Tag Autocomplete**: Fast tag suggestions with indexed search
- **Category Queries**: Optimized hierarchical category browsing
- **Trending Calculations**: Efficient algorithms for popular tag detection

## Security Considerations

### Activity Security
