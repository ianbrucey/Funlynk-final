# Epic Planning Structure

## Purpose

Epic planning establishes the architectural foundation for major system modules before detailed feature planning. Each epic represents a cohesive set of services and capabilities that work together.

## Epic Planning Documents

Each epic contains the following planning documents:

### 1. Epic Overview (`epic-overview.md`)
- Epic purpose and scope
- Component breakdown
- Dependencies on other epics
- Success criteria and acceptance criteria

### 2. Database Schema (`database-schema.md`)
- Complete table definitions for the epic
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes and constraints
- Data migration considerations

### 3. Service Architecture (`service-architecture.md`)
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- Internal service communication patterns
- External service integrations
- Scalability and performance considerations

### 4. API Contracts (`api-contracts.md`)
- High-level endpoint definitions
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Request/response data structures
- Error handling patterns

### 5. Integration Points (`integration-points.md`)
- How this epic integrates with other epics
- Data flow between services
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Shared infrastructure requirements

## Epic Dependencies

```
Tier 1: E01 Core Infrastructure (Foundation)
├── No dependencies
└── Required by: All other epics

Tier 2: Core Application Logic
├── E02 User & Profile Management (depends on E01)
├── E03 Activity Management (depends on E01, E02)
└── Required by: E04, E05, E06, E07

Tier 3: Discovery & Engagement
├── E04 Discovery Engine (depends on E01, E02, E03)
├── E05 Social Interaction (depends on E01, E02, E03)
└── Required by: E07

Tier 4: Monetization & Administration
├── E06 Payments & Monetization (depends on E01, E02, E03)
├── E07 Administration (depends on all other epics)
└── Required by: None (top-level features)
```

## Planning Process

1. **Start with E01 Core Infrastructure** (no dependencies)
2. **Plan epics in dependency order** (can't plan E02 without E01 complete)
3. **Review integration points** after each epic
4. **Validate cross-epic consistency** before moving to feature planning

## Status Tracking

Epic planning progress is tracked in the main `PLANNING-TRACKER.md` document.
