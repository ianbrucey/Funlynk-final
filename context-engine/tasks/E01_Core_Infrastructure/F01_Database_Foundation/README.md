# F01 Database Foundation

## Feature Overview

This feature establishes the core database foundation for the Funlynk platform using Supabase and PostgreSQL. It includes the complete database schema, security policies, and foundational data management capabilities that all other platform features depend on.

## Feature Scope

### In Scope
- Supabase project setup and configuration
- Complete database schema implementation (all tables from epic planning)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Database migrations and version control
- Performance optimization and indexing
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Out of Scope
- Application-level business logic (handled by service layers)
- Frontend database interactions (handled by API layers)
- Advanced analytics queries (handled by E07 Administration)

## Tasks Breakdown

### T01: Supabase Project Setup and Configuration
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Set up Supabase project, configure environment, and establish basic connection

### T02: Core Database Schema Implementation
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies**: T01
**Description**: Implement all database tables and relationships from epic planning

### T03: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: T02
**Description**: Implement comprehensive security policies for data access control

### T04: Database Migrations and Version Control
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: T02
**Description**: Set up migration system and version control for database changes

### T05: Performance Optimization and Indexing
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: T02
**Description**: Add indexes and optimize database performance for expected query patterns

### T06: Backup and Recovery Procedures
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: T01
**Description**: Configure automated backups and document recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Supabase project is configured and accessible
- [ ] All database tables are created with proper relationships
- [ ] RLS policies protect user data appropriately
- [ ] Migration system is functional and documented
- [ ] Database performance meets expected benchmarks
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested and documented

## Dependencies

### Blocks
- All other features depend on database foundation
- E02 User Management requires user tables
- E03 Activity Management requires activity tables
- E06 Payments requires financial tables

### External Dependencies
- Supabase account and project access
- Database design from epic planning documents
- Environment configuration and secrets management

## Technical Notes

- Follow database schema from E01 Core Infrastructure epic planning
- Implement all tables from all epics to avoid future migration complexity
- Use Supabase's built-in features for auth, real-time, and storage where possible
- Ensure GDPR compliance in data structure and access patterns
