# T01: Supabase Project Setup and Configuration - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to establish the foundational database infrastructure for the Funlynk platform. This requires setting up a Supabase project with proper configuration, environment management, and basic connectivity to support all platform features.

## Context

### Current State
- No database infrastructure exists
- Platform architecture has been fully planned across 7 epics
- Database schema has been designed but not implemented
- Development team needs a reliable, scalable database foundation

### Desired State
- Supabase project is configured and operational
- Development and production environments are properly separated
- Database connection is secure and performant
- Foundation is ready for schema implementation and application development

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Foundational Dependency**: All platform features depend on database infrastructure
- **Development Velocity**: Proper setup enables efficient development workflows
- **Security Foundation**: Correct configuration ensures data protection from day one
- **Scalability Preparation**: Proper setup supports future growth and scaling needs

### Success Metrics
- Database connection latency < 50ms for 95% of requests
- 99.9% database uptime availability
- Zero security vulnerabilities in database configuration
- Development team can connect and work within 1 hour of setup completion

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Supabase project created with appropriate tier/plan
- Database accessible from development environments
- Environment variables and secrets properly configured
- Basic monitoring and logging enabled
- Connection pooling configured for performance

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
- **Performance**: Connection pooling and optimization
- **Reliability**: Automated backups enabled
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks and alerting
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready configuration

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use Supabase as the database platform (architectural decision)
- Must support both development and production environments
- Must comply with data protection regulations
- Budget considerations for Supabase tier selection

### Assumptions
- Team has access to Supabase account creation
- Development team has necessary permissions for database access
- Environment secrets can be securely managed
- Network connectivity allows database access from development environments

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Supabase project created and accessible
- [ ] Database connection string available and tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption enabled and verified
- [ ] Basic monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] Connection pooling configured and tested

### Should Have
- [ ] Automated backup schedule configured
- [ ] Database performance baseline established
- [ ] Access logging enabled
- [ ] Development team onboarded with access credentials
- [ ] Basic security scan completed with no critical issues

### Could Have
- [ ] Custom domain configuration for database access
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting rules
- [ ] Database performance optimization recommendations
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Database Access Issues**: Incorrect configuration could block all development
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Poor setup could expose sensitive data
- **Performance Problems**: Inadequate configuration could impact user experience

### Medium Risk
- **Environment Confusion**: Mixing dev/prod environments could cause data issues
- **Cost Overruns**: Incorrect tier selection could lead to unexpected costs
- **Backup Failures**: Inadequate backup configuration could risk data loss

### Mitigation Strategies
- Follow Supabase best practices documentation
- Implement proper environment separation from the start
- Test all configurations in development before production deployment
- Document all setup steps for reproducibility and troubleshooting

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Supabase account with appropriate permissions
- Environment secrets management system
- Development team access credentials
- Network connectivity and firewall configurations

### Blocks
- All subsequent database tasks (T02-T06)
- All application development requiring database access
- Integration testing and deployment processes

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion
- [ ] Supabase project is created and configured
- [ ] Database connection is established and tested
- [ ] Environment variables are documented and secured
- [ ] Basic monitoring is functional
- [ ] Security configuration is verified
- [ ] Performance baseline is established

### Documentation Completion
- [ ] Setup process is documented for reproducibility
- [ ] Connection details are securely shared with team
- [ ] Environment configuration guide is created
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide is documented
- [ ] Security checklist is completed

### Validation Completion
- [ ] Database connection tested from multiple environments
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance meets baseline requirements
- [ ] Team members can successfully connect
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are verified
