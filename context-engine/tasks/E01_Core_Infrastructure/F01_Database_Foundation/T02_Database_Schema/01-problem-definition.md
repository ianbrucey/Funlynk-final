# T02: Core Database Schema Implementation - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to implement the complete database schema for the Funlynk platform based on the comprehensive design created during epic planning. This includes all tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes required to support the full platform functionality across all 7 epics.

## Context

### Current State
- Supabase project is set up and configured (T01 completed)
- Database connection is established and tested
- No application tables exist in the database
- Epic planning has defined comprehensive schema requirements

### Desired State
- All database tables are created with proper structure and relationships
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- Indexes are optimized for expected query patterns
- Database schema supports all planned platform features
- Schema is ready for Row Level Security (RLS) policy implementation

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Foundation for All Features**: Every platform feature depends on proper data storage
- **Data Integrity**: Proper schema design prevents data corruption and inconsistencies
- **Performance**: Well-designed schema with appropriate indexes ensures fast queries
- **Scalability**: Schema design supports platform growth to 1M+ users
- **Development Velocity**: Complete schema enables parallel feature development

### Success Metrics
- All tables created without errors
- Foreign key relationships properly established
- Query performance meets baseline requirements (<10ms for simple queries)
- Schema supports all epic requirements without modification
- Database size optimization for efficient storage

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Implement all tables from epic planning documents (E01-E07)
- Create proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Add appropriate indexes for query optimization
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at) where needed
- Support JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Enable UUID primary keys for all tables

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Optimized for read-heavy workloads with proper indexing
- **Scalability**: Schema design supports horizontal scaling patterns
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive constraints prevent invalid data
- **Flexibility**: JSONB fields allow for future feature expansion
- **Compliance**: Schema supports GDPR and data protection requirements

## Schema Overview

### Core Tables (E01 Core Infrastructure)
- `users` - User accounts and basic information
- `user_profiles` - Extended user profile data
- `user_sessions` - Session management
- `notifications` - Platform notifications
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail

### User Management Tables (E02)
- `user_preferences` - User settings and preferences
- `user_blocks` - User blocking relationships
- `follow_relationships` - Social following connections
- `user_verification_requests` - Identity verification
- `profile_images` - User profile image management

### Activity Tables (E03)
- `activities` - Core activity information
- `activity_images` - Activity photo management
- `activity_categories` - Activity categorization
- `activity_tags` - Flexible tagging system
- `rsvps` - Activity reservations and attendance
- `rsvp_responses` - RSVP form responses
- `waitlists` - Activity waitlist management

### Discovery Tables (E04)
- `user_interests` - User interest tracking
- `search_queries` - Search analytics
- `recommendation_cache` - Cached recommendations
- `user_activity_interactions` - Engagement tracking

### Social Tables (E05)
- `comments` - Activity comments and discussions
- `comment_reactions` - Comment likes and reactions
- `activity_reactions` - Activity engagement
- `communities` - Community groups
- `community_members` - Community membership
- `messages` - Direct messaging
- `social_shares` - Content sharing tracking

### Payment Tables (E06)
- `payment_methods` - User payment information
- `transactions` - Payment transactions
- `host_earnings` - Host revenue tracking
- `payouts` - Host payout records
- `subscriptions` - User subscription management
- `subscription_plans` - Available subscription tiers
- `discount_codes` - Promotional codes
- `pricing_strategies` - Dynamic pricing

### Administration Tables (E07)
- `analytics_events` - Event tracking
- `analytics_metrics` - Aggregated metrics
- `moderation_queue` - Content moderation
- `moderation_actions` - Moderation decisions
- `support_tickets` - Customer support
- `system_health_metrics` - System monitoring
- `admin_users` - Administrative access

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use PostgreSQL features available in Supabase
- Schema must support Row Level Security (RLS) implementation
- Must maintain referential integrity across all relationships
- Storage optimization for cost-effective scaling
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### Assumptions
- Supabase project is properly configured and accessible
- Epic planning documents contain complete schema requirements
- Development team has PostgreSQL and Supabase experience
- Schema can be implemented incrementally without breaking changes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All tables from epic planning are created
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are properly established
- [ ] Primary and unique constraints are implemented
- [ ] Basic indexes are created for performance
- [ ] JSONB fields are properly structured
- [ ] Audit fields are included where appropriate
- [ ] Schema validation passes without errors

### Should Have
- [ ] Performance indexes are optimized for expected queries
- [ ] Table comments document purpose and usage
- [ ] Enum types are used for constrained values
- [ ] Check constraints validate data integrity
- [ ] Composite indexes support complex queries
- [ ] Schema documentation is complete

### Could Have
- [ ] Advanced indexing strategies (partial, expression)
- [ ] Database functions for common operations
- [ ] Materialized views for analytics
- [ ] Custom data types for domain-specific needs
- [ ] Advanced constraint validation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Schema Errors**: Incorrect relationships could require complex migrations
- **Performance Issues**: Poor indexing could impact user experience
- **Data Integrity**: Missing constraints could allow invalid data

### Medium Risk
- **Storage Costs**: Inefficient schema design could increase costs
- **Migration Complexity**: Future schema changes could be difficult
- **Compliance Issues**: Schema might not support all regulatory requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thoroughly review epic planning documents before implementation
- Test schema with sample data before production deployment
- Implement comprehensive constraints and validation
- Plan for future schema evolution and migration strategies

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- T01: Supabase Project Setup (must be completed)
