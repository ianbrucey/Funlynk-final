# T03: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to implement comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all database tables to ensure users can only access data they're authorized to see. This is critical for data protection, privacy compliance (GDPR), and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information across the Funlynk platform.

## Context

### Current State
- Database schema is implemented with all tables and relationships (T02 completed)
- Supabase project is configured and operational (T01 completed)
- No security policies exist - all data is currently accessible to authenticated users
- Platform handles sensitive data including personal information, financial data, and private communications

### Desired State
- Comprehensive RLS policies protect all sensitive data
- Users can only access their own data and publicly available information
- Host-specific data is protected and only accessible to authorized hosts
- Administrative data is restricted to admin users only
- Privacy settings are enforced at the database level
- GDPR compliance is maintained through proper data access controls

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user information
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensures GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulation compliance
- **User Trust**: Users must trust that their data is secure and private
- **Legal Protection**: Proper security reduces liability and regulatory risk
- **Platform Integrity**: Security breaches could destroy platform reputation and business

### Success Metrics
- Zero unauthorized data access incidents
- 100% of sensitive data protected by appropriate RLS policies
- Privacy settings enforced consistently across all data access
- Compliance audit passes with no critical security findings
- User data access patterns match intended permissions

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **User Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own profile, activities, and related data
- **Public Data Access**: Publicly available information (activity listings, public profiles) accessible to all users
- **Host Authorization**: Activity hosts can access participant data for their activities only
- **Privacy Enforcement**: User privacy settings enforced at database level
- **Administrative Access**: Admin users have controlled access to necessary data for platform management
- **Audit Trail**: All data access is logged for security monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: RLS policies must not significantly impact query performance
- **Scalability**: Policies must work efficiently with millions of users and activities
- **Maintainability**: Policy structure should be clear and easy to update
- **Compliance**: Meet GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 requirements
- **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple layers of protection

## Security Model Overview

### User Access Levels
1. **Anonymous Users**: Can view public activity listings and basic platform information
2. **Authenticated Users**: Can access their own data and public information
3. **Activity Hosts**: Can access participant data for their own activities
4. **Premium Users**: May have additional data access based on subscription
5. **Admin Users**: Controlled access to platform management data
6. **System/Service**: Full access for automated platform operations

### Data Classification
1. **Public Data**: Activity listings, public profiles, platform content
2. **User Private Data**: Personal information, preferences, private messages
3. **Financial Data**: Payment methods, transactions, earnings (highest security)
4. **Host Data**: Activity management data, participant information
5. **Administrative Data**: Platform analytics, moderation data, system logs
6. **Audit Data**: Security logs, access records (read-only for most users)

## RLS Policy Categories

### 1. User Profile Policies
- Users can read/update their own profile data
- Public profile information visible to all authenticated users
- Private profile data only accessible to the user
- Admin users can access profiles for moderation purposes

### 2. Activity Management Policies
- Activity hosts can manage their own activities
- Public activities visible to all users
- Private activities only visible to invited users
- RSVP data accessible to hosts and participants

### 3. Social Interaction Policies
- Users can manage their own social connections
- Comments visible based on activity visibility
- Private messages only accessible to sender and recipient
- Community data based on membership and privacy settings

### 4. Financial Data Policies
- Users can only access their own payment methods and transactions
- Hosts can access earnings data for their activities
- Financial data requires additional authentication for sensitive operations
- Admin access for fraud prevention and compliance

### 5. Administrative Policies
- Analytics data accessible based on admin role and permissions
- Moderation data restricted to moderation team
- System monitoring data for operations team
- Audit logs for security and compliance teams

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use Supabase RLS implementation (PostgreSQL-based)
- Policies must not break existing Supabase Auth integration
- Performance impact must be minimal (<10% query overhead)
- Must support real-time subscriptions with proper filtering
- Compliance with data protection regulations required

### Assumptions
- Supabase Auth is properly configured and functional
- Database schema includes all necessary user identification fields
- Application will respect RLS policies and not attempt to bypass them
- Admin users will have proper authentication and authorization
- Audit logging is available for security monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All tables have appropriate RLS policies enabled
- [ ] Users can only access their own private data
- [ ] Public data is accessible to appropriate user levels
- [ ] Host-specific data access is properly controlled
- [ ] Financial data has enhanced security policies
- [ ] Admin access is properly restricted and logged
- [ ] Privacy settings are enforced at database level
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions respect RLS policies

### Should Have
- [ ] Policy performance impact is minimal (<10% overhead)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all access scenarios
- [ ] Clear documentation for all policy decisions
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive data access
- [ ] Policy violation detection and alerting
- [ ] Easy policy updates for future requirements

### Could Have
- [ ] Dynamic policy adjustment based on user subscription level
- [ ] Advanced privacy controls (granular sharing permissions)
- [ ] Temporary access grants for specific use cases
- [ ] Policy simulation and testing tools
- [ ] Automated policy compliance checking

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Policy Gaps**: Missing policies could expose sensitive data
- **Performance Impact**: Complex policies could slow down the platform
- **Compliance Violations**: Incorrect policies could violate privacy regulations

### Medium Risk
- **Policy Conflicts**: Overlapping policies could cause unexpected behavior
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Complex policy structure could be difficult to maintain
- **Testing Coverage**: Insufficient testing could miss security vulnerabilities

### Low Risk
- **User Experience**: Well-designed policies should be transparent to users
- **Integration Issues**: Supabase RLS is well-documented and stable

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing of all access scenarios before deployment
- Performance testing to ensure minimal impact on user experience
- Regular security audits and policy reviews
- Clear documentation and training for development team
- Gradual rollout with monitoring and rollback capabilities
