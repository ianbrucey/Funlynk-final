# T04: Database Migrations and Version Control - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to establish a robust database migration and version control system that allows for safe, repeatable, and trackable database schema changes throughout the development lifecycle. This system must support team collaboration, environment consistency, and production deployments while maintaining data integrity.

## Context

### Current State
- Database schema is implemented in Supabase (T02 completed)
- RLS policies are implemented for security (T03 completed)
- No formal migration system exists
- Schema changes are applied manually
- No version control for database structure
- Risk of environment inconsistencies

### Desired State
- Automated migration system using Supabase CLI
- Version-controlled database schema changes
- Safe rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- Consistent schema across all environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Team collaboration support for concurrent schema changes
- Automated migration execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can make schema changes safely and quickly
- **Data Integrity**: Migrations prevent data loss and corruption during schema changes
- **Environment Consistency**: All environments have identical database structure
- **Deployment Safety**: Automated migrations reduce human error in production
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on schema changes simultaneously
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick recovery from problematic schema changes

### Success Metrics
- Zero data loss incidents during schema changes
- 100% environment consistency across dev/staging/prod
- Migration execution time < 5 minutes for typical changes
- Zero manual schema interventions required
- Team can deploy schema changes multiple times per day safely

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Migration Creation**: Easy creation of new migration files
- **Migration Execution**: Automated application of pending migrations
- **Rollback Support**: Ability to undo migrations safely
- **Environment Sync**: Keep all environments in sync
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent migration development
- **Data Preservation**: Migrations must preserve existing data
- **Validation**: Pre-migration validation and post-migration verification

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Migrations execute quickly without blocking operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for migration execution
- **Auditability**: Complete history of all schema changes
- **Recoverability**: Ability to rebuild database from migrations
- **Scalability**: Support for large-scale schema changes
- **Security**: Migrations don't compromise database security

## Migration System Architecture

### Supabase CLI Migration Features
- **Local Development**: `supabase db diff` to generate migrations
- **Version Control**: Git-based migration file management
- **Environment Sync**: `supabase db push` and `supabase db pull`
- **Reset Capability**: `supabase db reset` for clean development
- **Remote Sync**: `supabase link` to connect to remote projects

### Migration File Structure
```
supabase/
├── config.toml                 # Supabase project configuration
├── seed.sql                    # Initial data seeding
└── migrations/
    ├── 20240101000000_initial_schema.sql
    ├── 20240102000000_add_user_preferences.sql
    ├── 20240103000000_create_activity_indexes.sql
    └── 20240104000000_update_rls_policies.sql
```

### Migration Naming Convention
- **Timestamp Prefix**: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_` for chronological ordering
- **Descriptive Name**: Clear description of the change
- **Action Prefix**: `create_`, `add_`, `update_`, `drop_`, `alter_`
- **Examples**:
  - `20240101120000_create_user_preferences_table.sql`
  - `20240102143000_add_activity_category_index.sql`
  - `20240103091500_update_user_privacy_policies.sql`

## Migration Types and Patterns

### 1. Schema Creation Migrations
```sql
-- Create new table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    preference_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    preference_value JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add RLS policies
ALTER TABLE user_preferences ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "users_own_preferences" ON user_preferences
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 2. Schema Modification Migrations
```sql
-- Add new column
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN max_participants INTEGER;

-- Modify existing column
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;

-- Add constraint
ALTER TABLE activities ADD CONSTRAINT check_max_participants 
    CHECK (max_participants > 0);
```

### 3. Data Migration Patterns
```sql
-- Update existing data
UPDATE activities 
SET max_participants = 50 
WHERE max_participants IS NULL;

-- Migrate data between tables
INSERT INTO user_preferences (user_id, preference_key, preference_value)
SELECT id, 'email_notifications', 'true'::jsonb
FROM users 
WHERE email_notifications = true;
```

### 4. Index and Performance Migrations
```sql
-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_activities_location 
ON activities USING GIST (location);

CREATE INDEX idx_rsvps_activity_user 
ON rsvps (activity_id, user_id);

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE activities;
```

## Environment Management Strategy

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**: Make schema changes locally
2. **Generate Migration**: Use `supabase db diff` to create migration file
3. **Test Migration**: Apply and test migration locally
4. **Code Review**: Review migration in pull request
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Apply migration to staging environment
6. **Production Deployment**: Apply migration to production

### Environment Synchronization
```bash
# Link to remote project
supabase link --project-ref [project-id]

# Pull remote schema to local
supabase db pull

# Generate migration from local changes
supabase db diff --file migration_name

# Push migrations to remote
supabase db push

# Reset local database to clean state
supabase db reset
```

### Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches**: Each feature gets its own migration files
- **Migration Conflicts**: Resolve by renaming and reordering migrations
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash related migrations before merging to main
- **Hotfix Migrations**: Emergency migrations get priority timestamps

## Data Safety and Rollback Strategy

### Pre-Migration Safety Checks
```sql
-- Validate data before migration
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Check for data consistency
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE email IS NULL) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot add NOT NULL constraint: null emails exist';
    END IF;
END $$;
```

### Rollback Patterns
```sql
-- Rollback for adding column (drop column)
ALTER TABLE activities DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS max_participants;

-- Rollback for constraint (drop constraint)
ALTER TABLE activities DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS check_max_participants;

-- Rollback for data changes (restore from backup)
-- Note: Data rollbacks require backup/restore procedures
```

### Backup Integration
- **Pre-Migration Backup**: Automatic backup before major migrations
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Use Supabase PITR for rollback
- **Migration Testing**: Test rollback procedures in staging
- **Recovery Documentation**: Clear procedures for emergency recovery
