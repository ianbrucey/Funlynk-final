# T06: Backup and Recovery Procedures - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to establish comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures to protect against data loss, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance requirements. This includes automated backup strategies, tested recovery procedures, and documented disaster recovery plans for the Funlynk platform.

## Context

### Current State
- Supabase provides basic automated daily backups on Pro tier
- No comprehensive backup strategy beyond default Supabase features
- No tested recovery procedures or disaster recovery plan
- No backup monitoring or validation processes
- No compliance-ready backup documentation
- Recovery procedures are untested and undocumented

### Desired State
- Comprehensive backup strategy covering all data types and scenarios
- Automated backup processes with monitoring and alerting
- Tested and documented recovery procedures for various failure scenarios
- Compliance-ready backup and retention policies
- Disaster recovery plan with defined RTO/RPO targets
- Regular backup validation and recovery testing

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Data Protection**: User data, financial records, and platform content must be protected
- **Business Continuity**: Platform must recover quickly from any data loss incident
- **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR, financial regulations require specific backup/retention policies
- **User Trust**: Users must trust that their data is safe and recoverable
- **Legal Protection**: Proper backup procedures reduce liability in case of data incidents
- **Competitive Advantage**: Reliable platform builds user confidence

### Success Metrics
- Zero permanent data loss incidents
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 4 hours for full platform recovery
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1 hour of data loss maximum
- 99.9% backup success rate
- Monthly disaster recovery tests pass successfully
- Compliance audit requirements met

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Automated Backups**: Regular, automated backup of all critical data
- **Backup Validation**: Automated verification of backup integrity
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of recovery procedures
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Ability to restore to specific timestamps
- **Cross-Region Backup**: Geographic distribution of backup data
- **Incremental Backups**: Efficient backup of only changed data
- **Backup Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for backup status

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Recovery Speed**: Fast recovery processes to minimize downtime
- **Storage Efficiency**: Cost-effective backup storage strategies
- **Security**: Encrypted backups with secure access controls
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data retention
- **Scalability**: Backup system scales with platform growth
- **Reliability**: 99.9% backup system uptime

## Backup Strategy Design

### 1. Backup Types and Frequency

#### Database Backups
- **Full Backups**: Daily full database backups
- **Incremental Backups**: Hourly incremental backups during business hours
- **Transaction Log Backups**: Continuous transaction log backup for point-in-time recovery
- **Schema Backups**: Separate backup of database schema and structure

#### Application Data Backups
- **User-Generated Content**: Photos, documents, profile images
- **Configuration Data**: Application settings, feature flags
- **Logs and Analytics**: Platform logs and analytics data (separate retention policy)

#### System Backups
- **Application Code**: Source code and deployment artifacts
- **Configuration Files**: Environment configurations and secrets
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, deployment scripts

### 2. Backup Retention Policy

#### Production Data
- **Daily Backups**: Retained for 30 days
- **Weekly Backups**: Retained for 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Monthly Backups**: Retained for 12 months (1 year)
- **Yearly Backups**: Retained for 7 years (compliance requirement)

#### Development/Staging Data
- **Daily Backups**: Retained for 7 days
- **Weekly Backups**: Retained for 4 weeks
- **No long-term retention**: Development data doesn't require extended retention

### 3. Geographic Distribution

#### Primary Backup Location
- **Same Region**: Fast recovery, low latency
- **Supabase Built-in**: Leverage Supabase's backup infrastructure

#### Secondary Backup Location
- **Different Region**: Protection against regional disasters
- **Cross-Cloud**: Consider backup to different cloud provider for maximum protection

## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- **Critical Systems**: 1 hour (authentication, core platform)
- **Full Platform**: 4 hours (complete platform restoration)
- **Non-Critical Features**: 24 hours (analytics, reporting)

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- **Financial Data**: 15 minutes (minimal transaction loss)
- **User Data**: 1 hour (acceptable user data loss)
- **Analytics Data**: 24 hours (analytics can tolerate more loss)

### Disaster Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Database Corruption
- **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
- **Response**: Point-in-time recovery from latest clean backup
- **RTO**: 2 hours, **RPO**: 1 hour

#### Scenario 2: Regional Outage
- **Detection**: Health checks fail, region unavailable
- **Response**: Failover to backup region with latest backup
- **RTO**: 4 hours, **RPO**: 4 hours

#### Scenario 3: Complete Data Loss
- **Detection**: All primary and regional backups compromised
- **Response**: Recovery from cross-cloud backup
- **RTO**: 8 hours, **RPO**: 24 hours

#### Scenario 4: Ransomware/Security Incident
- **Detection**: Security monitoring alerts
- **Response**: Isolate systems, recover from clean backup
- **RTO**: 6 hours, **RPO**: 4 hours

## Supabase Backup Integration

### Built-in Backup Features
- **Automatic Daily Backups**: Included with Pro tier
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Available on Team tier
- **Backup Retention**: 7 days (Pro), 28 days (Team)
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Available as add-on

### Enhanced Backup Strategy
```sql
-- Manual backup trigger
SELECT pg_start_backup('manual_backup_' || to_char(now(), 'YYYY-MM-DD_HH24-MI-SS'));

-- Backup validation query
SELECT pg_database_size(current_database()) as db_size,
       count(*) as table_count
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Point-in-time recovery preparation
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn() as current_wal_position;
```

### Backup Monitoring
```sql
-- Check backup status
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_archiver;

-- Monitor backup file sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Point-in-Time Recovery
```bash
# Supabase CLI point-in-time recovery
supabase db reset --db-url "postgresql://..." --target-time "2024-01-01 12:00:00"

# Verify recovery
supabase db diff --linked
```

### 2. Full Database Restore
```bash
# Download backup
supabase storage download backups/database_backup_20240101.sql

# Restore database
psql -h db.project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -f database_backup_20240101.sql

# Verify restore
psql -h db.project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT count(*) FROM users;"
```

### 3. Selective Data Recovery
```sql
-- Restore specific table from backup
CREATE TABLE users_backup AS SELECT * FROM users_backup_table;

-- Merge recovered data
INSERT INTO users SELECT * FROM users_backup 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
```

## Compliance and Security

### GDPR Compliance
- **Right to Erasure**: Backup data must support deletion requests
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data in backups
- **Retention Limits**: Automatic deletion after retention period
