# T01: User Registration and Login - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to implement core user registration and login functionality using Supabase Auth to provide secure, scalable authentication for the Funlynk platform. This includes user account creation, secure login processes, and integration with the database and frontend applications.

## Context

### Current State
- Supabase project is configured with Auth enabled (F01 Database Foundation complete)
- Database schema includes users table with proper structure
- No user registration or login functionality exists
- Frontend applications need authentication integration
- No user session management is implemented

### Desired State
- Users can register new accounts with email and password
- Secure login process with proper session management
- Integration with Supabase Auth for user management
- Frontend authentication state management
- Database integration with user profiles and RLS policies
- Secure token handling and refresh mechanisms

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **User Onboarding**: Essential for users to access platform features
- **Security Foundation**: Secure authentication protects user data and platform integrity
- **Platform Access**: Required for all user-specific functionality
- **Trust Building**: Professional authentication experience builds user confidence
- **Scalability**: Robust authentication system supports platform growth

### Success Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 85%
- Login success rate > 99%
- Registration process completion time < 30 seconds
- Login response time < 2 seconds
- Zero security incidents related to authentication
- User satisfaction with authentication experience > 4.5/5

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **User Registration**: Email/password account creation with validation
- **User Login**: Secure authentication with session establishment
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of email, password, and user data
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful failure handling
- **Session Management**: Secure session creation and maintenance
- **Database Integration**: User record creation and profile initialization
- **Frontend Integration**: Authentication state management across applications

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Industry-standard password hashing and secure transmission
- **Performance**: Fast authentication response times
- **Reliability**: 99.9% authentication service availability
- **Usability**: Intuitive and user-friendly authentication interface
- **Scalability**: Support for high concurrent authentication requests
- **Compliance**: Meet security standards and regulatory requirements

## Authentication Flow Design

### Registration Flow
1. **User Input**: Email, password, and basic profile information
2. **Validation**: Client-side and server-side input validation
3. **Account Creation**: Supabase Auth user creation
4. **Profile Initialization**: Create user profile record in database
5. **Email Verification**: Send verification email (if enabled)
6. **Session Establishment**: Create authenticated session
7. **Redirect**: Navigate to onboarding or dashboard

### Login Flow
1. **User Input**: Email and password credentials
2. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth credential verification
3. **Session Creation**: Establish authenticated session with JWT tokens
4. **User Data Retrieval**: Fetch user profile and preferences
5. **Authorization Check**: Verify user permissions and account status
6. **Redirect**: Navigate to appropriate dashboard or previous page

### Session Management
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh for extended sessions
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain session across browser sessions
- **Logout**: Secure session termination and cleanup

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- **Minimum Requirements**: 8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters
- **Strength Validation**: Real-time password strength feedback
- **Secure Transmission**: HTTPS encryption for all authentication requests
- **Hashing**: Supabase Auth handles secure password hashing

### Attack Prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks on login attempts
- **Input Sanitization**: Protect against injection attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **XSS Protection**: Cross-site scripting prevention
- **Session Security**: Secure session token handling

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: User consent and data protection compliance
- **Password Policies**: Meet industry standard password requirements
- **Audit Logging**: Log authentication events for security monitoring
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest

## Integration Requirements

### Supabase Auth Integration
```javascript
// Registration example
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'securepassword',
  options: {
    data: {
      display_name: 'User Name',
      username: 'username'
    }
  }
});

// Login example
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'securepassword'
});
```

### Database Integration
- **User Profile Creation**: Automatic profile record creation on registration
- **RLS Policy Integration**: Ensure proper row-level security
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain consistency between auth and profile data
- **Trigger Functions**: Database triggers for user lifecycle events

### Frontend Integration
- **React/Next.js**: Authentication context and state management
- **React Native**: Mobile authentication integration
- **Route Protection**: Secure routing based on authentication status
- **UI Components**: Reusable authentication components

## Constraints and Assumptions
