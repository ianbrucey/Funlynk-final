## Password Security Policy

### Password Requirements
```typescript
interface PasswordPolicy {
  minLength: number;           // 8 characters minimum
  maxLength: number;           // 128 characters maximum
  requireUppercase: boolean;   // At least one uppercase letter
  requireLowercase: boolean;   // At least one lowercase letter
  requireNumbers: boolean;     // At least one number
  requireSpecialChars: boolean; // At least one special character
  forbidCommonPasswords: boolean; // Block common/weak passwords
  forbidPersonalInfo: boolean;  // Block passwords containing user info
  preventReuse: number;        // Prevent reusing last N passwords
}

const defaultPasswordPolicy: PasswordPolicy = {
  minLength: 8,
  maxLength: 128,
  requireUppercase: true,
  requireLowercase: true,
  requireNumbers: true,
  requireSpecialChars: true,
  forbidCommonPasswords: true,
  forbidPersonalInfo: true,
  preventReuse: 5
};
```

### Password Strength Validation
```typescript
interface PasswordStrength {
  score: number;        // 0-4 (weak to very strong)
  feedback: string[];   // Specific improvement suggestions
  isValid: boolean;     // Meets minimum requirements
  estimatedCrackTime: string; // Human-readable crack time estimate
}

const validatePasswordStrength = (password: string, userInfo?: UserInfo): PasswordStrength => {
  // Implementation would use libraries like zxcvbn for strength calculation
  // and custom validation for policy compliance
};
```

## Password Reset Workflow

### Reset Request Flow
1. **Email Input**: User enters email address
2. **Account Verification**: Verify email exists in system
3. **Token Generation**: Generate secure reset token with expiration
4. **Email Dispatch**: Send reset email with secure link
5. **User Notification**: Confirm email sent (without revealing account existence)

### Reset Completion Flow
1. **Link Validation**: Validate reset token and expiration
2. **Password Input**: User enters new password
3. **Password Validation**: Validate against security policy
4. **Password Update**: Securely update password in Supabase Auth
5. **Session Invalidation**: Invalidate all existing sessions
6. **Confirmation**: Confirm successful password reset

### Security Considerations
```typescript
interface PasswordResetToken {
  token: string;           // Cryptographically secure random token
  userId: string;          // Associated user ID
  email: string;           // User email for verification
  expiresAt: Date;         // Token expiration (15 minutes)
  usedAt?: Date;           // When token was used (one-time use)
  createdAt: Date;         // Token creation timestamp
}

// Reset token security
const generateResetToken = (): string => {
  // Generate cryptographically secure random token
  return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
};

const validateResetToken = (token: string): boolean => {
  // Validate token format, expiration, and usage
  // Implement rate limiting for token validation attempts
};
```

## Password Change Workflow

### Authenticated Password Change
1. **Current Password Verification**: Verify user knows current password
2. **New Password Input**: User enters new password
3. **Password Validation**: Validate against security policy
4. **Confirmation Input**: User confirms new password
5. **Password Update**: Update password in Supabase Auth
6. **Session Refresh**: Refresh current session tokens
7. **Confirmation**: Confirm successful password change

### Security Features
- **Current Password Required**: Prevent unauthorized password changes
- **Session Validation**: Ensure user is properly authenticated
- **Password History**: Prevent reuse of recent passwords
- **Audit Logging**: Log all password change events
- **Email Notification**: Notify user of password changes

## Email Integration

### Password Reset Email Template
```html
<!-- Password Reset Email -->
<div>
  <h2>Reset Your Funlynk Password</h2>
  <p>We received a request to reset your password. Click the link below to create a new password:</p>
  
  <a href="{{reset_link}}" style="background: #007bff; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px;">
    Reset Password
  </a>
  
  <p>This link will expire in 15 minutes for security reasons.</p>
  <p>If you didn't request this reset, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
  
  <p>For security, this link will only work once.</p>
</div>
```

### Password Change Notification
```html
<!-- Password Change Notification -->
<div>
  <h2>Password Changed Successfully</h2>
  <p>Your Funlynk account password was changed on {{date}} at {{time}}.</p>
  
  <p>If you made this change, no further action is needed.</p>
  
  <p>If you didn't change your password, please contact support immediately:</p>
  <a href="mailto:security@funlynk.com">security@funlynk.com</a>
</div>
```

## User Interface Design

### Password Reset Form
```typescript
interface PasswordResetFormState {
  email: string;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isSubmitted: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

// Password reset form validation
const validateResetForm = (email: string): string | null => {
  if (!email) return 'Email is required';
  if (!isValidEmail(email)) return 'Please enter a valid email address';
  return null;
};
```

### Password Change Form
```typescript
interface PasswordChangeFormState {
  currentPassword: string;
  newPassword: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
  passwordStrength: PasswordStrength;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

// Real-time password validation
const validatePasswordChange = (formState: PasswordChangeFormState): ValidationResult => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  if (!formState.currentPassword) {
    errors.push('Current password is required');
  }
  
  if (!formState.newPassword) {
    errors.push('New password is required');
  } else if (!formState.passwordStrength.isValid) {
    errors.push(...formState.passwordStrength.feedback);
  }
  
  if (formState.newPassword !== formState.confirmPassword) {
    errors.push('Passwords do not match');
  }
  
  return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};
```

## Error Handling and Security

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
const rateLimits = {
  passwordReset: {
    maxAttempts: 3,           // Max reset requests per email
    windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour window
    blockDuration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hour block
  },
  passwordChange: {
    maxAttempts: 5,           // Max change attempts
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minute window
    blockDuration: 60 * 60 * 1000 // 1 hour block
  }
};
```

### Security Monitoring
```typescript
interface PasswordSecurityEvent {
  eventType: 'reset_requested' | 'reset_completed' | 'change_completed' | 'failed_attempt';
  userId?: string;
  email: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```
