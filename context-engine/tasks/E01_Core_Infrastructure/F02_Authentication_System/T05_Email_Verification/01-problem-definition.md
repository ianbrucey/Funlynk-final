## Email Verification Workflow

### Registration Verification Flow
1. **Account Creation**: User completes registration form
2. **Account Creation**: Create user account in pending verification state
3. **Token Generation**: Generate secure verification token
4. **Email Dispatch**: Send verification email with secure link
5. **User Notification**: Display verification required message
6. **Link Click**: User clicks verification link in email
7. **Token Validation**: Validate token and mark email as verified
8. **Account Activation**: Activate account and redirect to onboarding

### Email Change Verification Flow
1. **Email Change Request**: User requests to change email address
2. **Current Email Notification**: Send notification to current email
3. **New Email Verification**: Send verification to new email address
4. **Token Validation**: User clicks verification link
5. **Email Update**: Update email address in user account
6. **Confirmation**: Send confirmation to both old and new emails

### Verification Token Security
```typescript
interface EmailVerificationToken {
  token: string;           // Cryptographically secure random token
  userId: string;          // Associated user ID
  email: string;           // Email address being verified
  type: 'registration' | 'email_change'; // Verification type
  expiresAt: Date;         // Token expiration (24 hours)
  usedAt?: Date;           // When token was used (one-time use)
  createdAt: Date;         // Token creation timestamp
}

// Token generation and validation
const generateVerificationToken = (): string => {
  return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
};

const validateVerificationToken = (token: string): TokenValidationResult => {
  // Validate token format, expiration, and usage
  // Implement rate limiting for token validation attempts
};
```

## Email Templates and Content

### Registration Verification Email
```html
<!-- Email Verification Template -->
<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
  <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{logo_url}}" alt="Funlynk" style="height: 40px;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="padding: 30px 20px;">
    <h2 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 20px;">Welcome to Funlynk!</h2>
    
    <p>Thanks for joining Funlynk! To complete your registration and start discovering amazing activities, please verify your email address.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
      <a href="{{verification_link}}" 
         style="background: #007bff; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block; font-weight: bold;">
        Verify Email Address
      </a>
    </div>
    
    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px;">
      This verification link will expire in 24 hours for security reasons.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px;">
      If you didn't create a Funlynk account, you can safely ignore this email.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; text-align: center; color: #666; font-size: 12px;">
    <p>If the button doesn't work, copy and paste this link into your browser:</p>
    <p style="word-break: break-all;">{{verification_link}}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Email Change Verification
```html
<!-- Email Change Verification Template -->
<div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
  <h2>Verify Your New Email Address</h2>
  
  <p>You requested to change your Funlynk email address to: <strong>{{new_email}}</strong></p>
  
  <p>To complete this change, please click the verification link below:</p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
    <a href="{{verification_link}}" 
       style="background: #007bff; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;">
      Verify New Email
    </a>
  </div>
  
  <p style="color: #666; font-size: 14px;">
    This link will expire in 24 hours. If you didn't request this change, please contact support.
  </p>
</div>
```

## User Interface Design

### Verification Status Display
```typescript
interface EmailVerificationState {
  isVerified: boolean;
  email: string;
  verificationSentAt?: Date;
  canResend: boolean;
  resendCooldown?: number; // seconds until can resend
}

// Verification status component
const EmailVerificationBanner = ({ state }: { state: EmailVerificationState }) => {
  if (state.isVerified) return null;
  
  return (
    <div className="verification-banner">
      <div className="verification-message">
        <Icon name="mail" />
        <span>Please verify your email address ({state.email}) to access all features.</span>
      </div>
      
      <div className="verification-actions">
        {state.canResend ? (
          <button onClick={handleResendVerification}>
            Resend Verification Email
          </button>
        ) : (
          <span>Resend available in {state.resendCooldown}s</span>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Email Change Form
```typescript
interface EmailChangeFormState {
  newEmail: string;
  currentPassword: string;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error?: string;
  success?: boolean;
}

const validateEmailChange = (formState: EmailChangeFormState): ValidationResult => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  if (!formState.newEmail) {
    errors.push('New email address is required');
  } else if (!isValidEmail(formState.newEmail)) {
    errors.push('Please enter a valid email address');
  }
  
  if (!formState.currentPassword) {
    errors.push('Current password is required for security');
  }
  
  return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};
```

## Security and Rate Limiting

### Verification Security
```typescript
const verificationSecurity = {
  tokenExpiry: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,    // 24 hours
  maxTokensPerEmail: 5,                 // Max active tokens per email
  resendCooldown: 60 * 1000,           // 1 minute between resends
  maxResendAttempts: 3,                // Max resends per hour
  
  // Rate limiting
  rateLimits: {
    verification: {
      maxAttempts: 10,                  // Max verification attempts
      windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,        // 1 hour window
      blockDuration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hour block
    },
    resend: {
      maxAttempts: 5,                   // Max resend requests
      windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,        // 1 hour window
      blockDuration: 60 * 60 * 1000    // 1 hour block
    }
  }
};
```

### Security Event Logging
```typescript
interface EmailVerificationEvent {
  eventType: 'verification_sent' | 'verification_completed' | 'verification_failed' | 'email_changed';
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  newEmail?: string; // For email change events
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Feature Restrictions for Unverified Users

### Restricted Features
```typescript
const unverifiedUserRestrictions = {
  // Core restrictions
  canCreateActivities: false,
  canJoinActivities: false,
  canSendMessages: false,
  canReceiveNotifications: false,
  
  // Social restrictions
  canFollowUsers: false,
  canCommentOnActivities: false,
  canUploadImages: false,
  
  // Payment restrictions
  canMakePayments: false,
  canReceivePayments: false,
  
  // Limits
  maxProfileViews: 10,        // Limited profile browsing
  maxSearchQueries: 5,        // Limited search usage
};

// Feature gate component
const FeatureGate = ({ 
  feature, 
  isEmailVerified, 
  children 
}: FeatureGateProps) => {
  if (!isEmailVerified && unverifiedUserRestrictions[feature] === false) {
    return <EmailVerificationPrompt feature={feature} />;
  }
  
  return children;
};
```

## Integration with Supabase Auth

### Supabase Email Verification
```typescript
// Supabase Auth email verification integration
const supabaseEmailConfig = {
  // Email verification settings
  emailConfirmation: true,
  emailChangeConfirmation: true,
  
  // Email templates
  templates: {
    confirmation: {
      subject: 'Verify your Funlynk email address',
      template: 'verification_email_template'
    },
    emailChange: {
      subject: 'Verify your new email address',
      template: 'email_change_template'
    }
  },
  
  // Redirect URLs
  redirectUrls: {
    emailConfirmation: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/auth/verify`,
    emailChange: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/auth/email-change-confirm`
  }
};
