## Account Recovery Scenarios

### Standard Recovery Scenarios
1. **Forgotten Password + Email Access**: Standard password reset flow
2. **Forgotten Password + No Email Access**: Alternative verification methods
3. **Compromised Account**: Security-focused recovery with verification
4. **Lost Device**: Recovery when primary device is unavailable
5. **Email Address Changed**: Recovery when email is no longer accessible

### Advanced Recovery Workflow
```typescript
interface AccountRecoveryRequest {
  userId?: string;
  email?: string;
  username?: string;
  recoveryType: 'password_reset' | 'email_change' | 'compromised_account' | 'lost_device';
  verificationMethods: VerificationMethod[];
  securityQuestions?: SecurityQuestionAnswer[];
  supportingEvidence?: string;
  requestedAt: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
}

interface VerificationMethod {
  type: 'email' | 'phone' | 'security_questions' | 'identity_verification' | 'social_verification';
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  attempts: number;
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Recovery Verification Steps
1. **Identity Verification**: Confirm user identity through multiple methods
2. **Account Ownership**: Verify legitimate ownership of the account
3. **Security Assessment**: Evaluate potential security risks
4. **Recovery Authorization**: Authorize recovery based on verification results
5. **Account Restoration**: Restore account access with security measures
6. **Security Notification**: Notify user of successful recovery

## Security Monitoring System

### Suspicious Activity Detection
```typescript
interface SecurityEvent {
  eventType: 'login_attempt' | 'password_change' | 'email_change' | 'unusual_location' | 'device_change';
  userId: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  riskScore: number; // 0-100
  details: {
    ipAddress: string;
    location?: string;
    device: string;
    userAgent: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  automated: boolean;
  resolved: boolean;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
}

// Risk scoring algorithm
const calculateRiskScore = (event: SecurityEvent): number => {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Location-based risk
  if (event.details.location && isUnusualLocation(event.userId, event.details.location)) {
    score += 30;
  }
  
  // Device-based risk
  if (isNewDevice(event.userId, event.details.device)) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Time-based risk
  if (isUnusualTime(event.userId, event.details.timestamp)) {
    score += 15;
  }
  
  // Frequency-based risk
  if (hasRecentFailedAttempts(event.userId)) {
    score += 25;
  }
  
  return Math.min(score, 100);
};
```

### Automated Security Responses
```typescript
interface SecurityResponse {
  trigger: SecurityEvent;
  action: 'log_only' | 'email_notification' | 'require_verification' | 'temporary_lockout' | 'permanent_lockout';
  automated: boolean;
  executedAt: Date;
  details: string;
}

// Automated response rules
const securityResponseRules = {
  highRiskLogin: {
    condition: (event: SecurityEvent) => event.riskScore > 70,
    action: 'require_verification',
    notification: true
  },
  
  multipleFailedAttempts: {
    condition: (userId: string) => getFailedAttempts(userId, '1h') > 5,
    action: 'temporary_lockout',
    duration: 30 * 60 * 1000 // 30 minutes
  },
  
  compromisedAccount: {
    condition: (event: SecurityEvent) => event.severity === 'critical',
    action: 'permanent_lockout',
    requireManualReview: true
  }
};
```

## Account Security Controls

### Account Lockout System
```typescript
interface AccountLockout {
  userId: string;
  type: 'temporary' | 'permanent' | 'security_review';
  reason: string;
  lockedAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
  lockedBy: 'system' | 'admin' | 'user';
  unlockConditions?: string[];
  appealable: boolean;
}

// Lockout management
const lockoutReasons = {
  MULTIPLE_FAILED_LOGINS: 'Multiple failed login attempts',
  SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY: 'Suspicious account activity detected',
  COMPROMISED_ACCOUNT: 'Account appears to be compromised',
  POLICY_VIOLATION: 'Account policy violation',
  USER_REQUEST: 'User requested account lockout',
  ADMIN_ACTION: 'Administrative security action'
};
```

### Security Verification Methods
```typescript
interface SecurityVerification {
  method: 'email_verification' | 'phone_verification' | 'security_questions' | 'identity_document';
  required: boolean;
  completed: boolean;
  attempts: number;
  maxAttempts: number;
  expiresAt: Date;
}

// Multi-factor verification for high-risk scenarios
const requireSecurityVerification = (userId: string, riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'): SecurityVerification[] => {
  const verifications: SecurityVerification[] = [];
  
  // Always require email verification
  verifications.push({
    method: 'email_verification',
    required: true,
    completed: false,
    attempts: 0,
    maxAttempts: 3,
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  });
  
  // High-risk scenarios require additional verification
  if (riskLevel === 'high') {
    verifications.push({
      method: 'security_questions',
      required: true,
      completed: false,
      attempts: 0,
      maxAttempts: 3,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
    });
  }
  
  return verifications;
};
```

## Security Notifications

### Real-time Security Alerts
```typescript
interface SecurityNotification {
  userId: string;
  type: 'security_alert' | 'account_recovery' | 'lockout_notice' | 'verification_required';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  actionRequired: boolean;
  actionUrl?: string;
  sentAt: Date;
  channels: ('email' | 'push' | 'in_app')[];
}

// Security notification templates
const securityNotificationTemplates = {
  suspiciousLogin: {
    title: 'Unusual login activity detected',
    message: 'We detected a login to your account from a new location or device. If this was you, no action is needed. If not, please secure your account immediately.',
    actionRequired: true,
    actionUrl: '/security/review-activity'
  },
  
  accountLocked: {
    title: 'Account temporarily locked for security',
    message: 'Your account has been temporarily locked due to suspicious activity. You can unlock it by verifying your identity.',
    actionRequired: true,
    actionUrl: '/security/unlock-account'
  },
  
  recoveryCompleted: {
    title: 'Account recovery completed',
    message: 'Your account recovery has been completed successfully. If you did not request this recovery, please contact support immediately.',
    actionRequired: false
  }
};
```

## Administrative Recovery Tools

### Support Dashboard Features
```typescript
interface AdminRecoveryTools {
  // Account lookup and verification
  lookupAccount: (identifier: string) => Promise<AccountInfo>;
  verifyIdentity: (userId: string, evidence: IdentityEvidence) => Promise<VerificationResult>;
  
  // Recovery actions
  initiateRecovery: (userId: string, recoveryType: string) => Promise<RecoverySession>;
  overrideSecurityLock: (userId: string, reason: string) => Promise<void>;
