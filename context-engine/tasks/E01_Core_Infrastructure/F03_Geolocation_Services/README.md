# F03: Geolocation Services - Feature Overview

## Feature Summary

The Geolocation Services feature provides comprehensive location-based functionality for the Funlynk platform, enabling users to discover activities near them, create location-based activities, and interact with the platform's spatial features. This feature integrates PostGIS spatial database capabilities with modern mapping and location services.

## Business Context

### Why This Feature Matters
- **Core Value Proposition**: Location is fundamental to Funlynk's activity discovery model
- **User Experience**: Users need to find activities "near me" efficiently
- **Activity Creation**: Hosts need to specify where activities take place
- **Discovery Algorithm**: Location is a primary factor in activity recommendations
- **Mobile Experience**: Essential for mobile users discovering activities on-the-go

### Success Metrics
- Activity discovery by location accounts for >70% of user searches
- Location-based activity recommendations have >40% engagement rate
- Average location search response time <500ms
- Location accuracy within 100m for 95% of activities
- User satisfaction with location features >4.2/5

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- F01: Database Foundation (PostGIS requires PostgreSQL setup)
- F02: Authentication System (location permissions require user accounts)
- External API accounts (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.)
- Mobile platform location permissions

### Dependent Features
- E03: Activity Management (activities require location data)
- E04: Social Features (location-based social interactions)
- E05: Discovery & Engagement (location-based recommendations)

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- PostGIS spatial extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis_topology;

-- Location data types
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_known_location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326);

-- Spatial indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_location ON activities USING GIST (location);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_location ON users USING GIST (last_known_location);
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Location-based activity search
GET /api/activities/nearby?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius}

// Geocoding services
POST /api/geocoding/forward    // Address to coordinates
POST /api/geocoding/reverse    // Coordinates to address

// Location privacy
PUT /api/users/location-privacy
GET /api/users/location-settings
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Proximity Search**: <500ms response time for 10km radius searches
- **Geocoding**: <200ms response time for address resolution
- **Map Loading**: <2s initial map load time
- **Spatial Queries**: Support for 100k+ activities with sub-second response
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle 1000+ concurrent location requests

## Security and Privacy

### Location Privacy Controls
- **Granular Sharing**: Users control who sees their location
- **Approximate Location**: Option to share approximate vs. exact location
- **Location History**: User control over location data retention
- **Anonymous Mode**: Use platform without sharing personal location

### Security Measures
- **API Key Protection**: Secure storage and rotation of mapping API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of geocoding and mapping services
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive location data at rest
- **Access Controls**: Proper authorization for location-based queries

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Spatial query functions and geocoding logic
- **Integration Tests**: External API integrations and error handling
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset spatial queries and response times

- **Accuracy Issues**: Geocoding may be inaccurate in some regions
- **Cost Management**: Mapping API costs could escalate with usage

### Low Risk
- **Map Display Issues**: Minor visual or interaction problems
- **Offline Limitations**: Reduced functionality without internet

### Mitigation Strategies
