## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- F01: Database Foundation (notification storage and user data)
- F02: Authentication System (user identification and preferences)
- External service accounts (Firebase, SendGrid, Twilio)
- Mobile app push notification setup

### Dependent Features
- E03: Activity Management (activity notification triggers)
- E04: Social Features (social interaction notifications)
- E05: Discovery & Engagement (recommendation notifications)
- All user-facing features requiring notifications

## Technical Specifications

### Notification Data Model
```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  channel: NotificationChannel[];
  title: string;
  body: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  scheduledFor?: Date;
  sentAt?: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
  status: NotificationStatus;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
}

enum NotificationType {
  ACTIVITY_NEW = 'activity_new',
  ACTIVITY_UPDATE = 'activity_update',
  ACTIVITY_REMINDER = 'activity_reminder',
  SOCIAL_FOLLOW = 'social_follow',
  SOCIAL_COMMENT = 'social_comment',
  SYSTEM_UPDATE = 'system_update'
}

enum NotificationChannel {
  PUSH = 'push',
  EMAIL = 'email',
  SMS = 'sms',
  IN_APP = 'in_app'
}
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Send notification
POST /api/notifications/send

// Get user notifications
GET /api/notifications?userId={userId}&limit={limit}&offset={offset}

// Update notification preferences
PUT /api/users/{userId}/notification-preferences

// Mark notification as read
PUT /api/notifications/{notificationId}/read

// Get notification analytics
GET /api/notifications/analytics?timeRange={range}
```

### Performance Requirements
