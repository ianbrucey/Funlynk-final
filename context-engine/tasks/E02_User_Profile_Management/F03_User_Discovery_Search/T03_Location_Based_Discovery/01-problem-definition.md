# T03: Location-Based Discovery - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

We need to implement a comprehensive location-based discovery system that enables users to find nearby community members through proximity-based search, geofencing, location privacy controls, and map-based discovery interfaces. This system must balance effective location-based matching with robust privacy protections and user control over location sharing.

## Context

### Current State
- Advanced search engine provides general user discovery (T01 completed)
- Intelligent recommendations suggest relevant users (T02 completed)
- Geolocation services infrastructure exists (E01.F03 completed)
- Privacy controls are implemented (F02 completed)
- No location-based user discovery functionality
- No proximity-based matching or nearby user features

### Desired State
- Proximity-based user discovery with configurable search radius
- Location privacy controls with granular sharing options
- Geofencing capabilities for location-based notifications and discovery
- Map-based discovery interface with user clustering and visualization
- Location-aware recommendations that respect privacy preferences
- Real-time location updates for active discovery features

## Business Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Local Connections**: Location-based discovery drives 40% higher connection rates
- **Activity Participation**: Nearby users are 3x more likely to join local activities
- **User Engagement**: Location features increase daily active usage by 25%
- **Community Building**: Proximity-based connections create stronger local communities
- **Platform Differentiation**: Location features differentiate from purely online platforms
- **Monetization Opportunities**: Location-based features enable local business partnerships

### Success Metrics
- Location-based discovery adoption >45% of users enable location features
- Nearby connection success rate >35% vs <15% for general discovery
- Local activity participation increase >50% for users using location discovery
- Location feature engagement >30% of active users use location features weekly
- User satisfaction with location privacy controls >4.5/5
- Location-based recommendation click-through rate >25%

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Proximity Search**: Find users within configurable radius (1km to 100km)
- **Location Privacy Controls**: Granular control over location sharing and visibility
- **Geofencing**: Location-based triggers for notifications and discovery
- **Map Interface**: Visual map-based discovery with user clustering
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live location updates for active discovery sessions
- **Location History**: Optional location history for improved recommendations
- **Privacy Zones**: Ability to set private locations (home, work) with restricted sharing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Privacy**: Strong location privacy protections with user consent
- **Performance**: Location queries complete within 300ms
- **Accuracy**: Location matching accurate within 100m for precise discovery
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimal battery impact from location tracking
- **Scalability**: Support millions of users with real-time location queries
- **Security**: Encrypted location data storage and transmission

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must comply with location privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Must provide strong user control over location sharing
- Must minimize battery impact from location tracking
- Must handle location accuracy variations and GPS limitations
- Must protect against location-based harassment or stalking

### Assumptions
- Users want to find nearby community members for local connections
- Location-based discovery will increase activity participation
- Users will share location when they understand privacy controls

- [ ] Geofencing capabilities for location-based triggers and notifications
- [ ] Map-based discovery interface with user clustering and visualization
- [ ] Real-time location updates for active discovery sessions
- [ ] Private zone functionality to protect sensitive locations
- [ ] Location-based recommendations that respect privacy preferences

### Should Have
- [ ] Location history tracking with user consent and control
- [ ] Advanced geofencing with custom shapes and actions
- [ ] Location-based activity suggestions and recommendations

- **Feature Complexity**: Advanced location features might be complex to implement

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive privacy controls and user education
- Strong encryption and security for location data
- Anti-harassment features and reporting mechanisms
- Battery optimization and efficient location tracking
- Performance optimization for location queries and updates
