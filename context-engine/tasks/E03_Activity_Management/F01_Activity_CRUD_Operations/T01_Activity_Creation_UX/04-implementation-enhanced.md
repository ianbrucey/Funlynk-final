## Success Metrics

### Design Quality Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: Target 85%+ users complete creation flow
- **Time to Complete**: Average 90 seconds for basic, 3 minutes for detailed
- **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of attempts fail due to UX issues
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ stars in usability testing

### Deliverable Quality Metrics
- **Design Consistency**: 100% adherence to design system
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- **Developer Handoff**: Zero clarification requests during implementation
- **Prototype Accuracy**: 95%+ match between prototype and final implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Complex Flow**: Risk of overwhelming users with too many options
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults, skip options
  
- **Mobile Constraints**: Limited screen space for rich creation experience
  - *Mitigation*: Multi-step flow, collapsible sections, thumb-friendly design
  
- **Performance**: Rich interactions may impact app performance
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize animations, lazy load content, test on low-end devices

### Contingency Plans
- **Simplified Flow**: Fallback to 3-step flow if 5-step proves too complex
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features
- **A/B Testing**: Plan for testing different flow variations

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- [ ] **Design System**: Funlynk component library must be available
- [ ] **Brand Guidelines**: Updated brand assets and color palette
- [ ] **User Research**: Persona definitions and user testing insights

### Potential Blockers
- **Design System Changes**: Updates to core components may require redesign
- **Technical Limitations**: React Native constraints may limit design options
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Major changes requested during review process

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (After Task Completion)
1. **Design Review**: Present designs to stakeholders for approval
2. **Developer Handoff**: Transfer specifications to T03 Frontend Implementation
3. **User Testing**: Plan usability testing sessions with target users
4. **Iteration Planning**: Prepare for design refinements based on feedback

### Future Considerations
- **Template Integration**: How templates affect the creation flow (T06)
- **Advanced Features**: Recurring events, co-host invitations
- **Personalization**: AI-powered suggestions and smart defaults
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support and cultural adaptations
