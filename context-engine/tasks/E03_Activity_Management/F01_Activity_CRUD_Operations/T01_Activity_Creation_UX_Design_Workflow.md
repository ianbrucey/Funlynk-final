# T01 Activity Creation UX Design & Workflow

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Design the complete user experience for activity creation, from initial concept to published activity. This includes creating intuitive workflows that guide hosts through the activity creation process while ensuring all necessary information is captured efficiently and accurately.

### Problem Statement
Activity hosts need a streamlined, intuitive interface to:
- **Create engaging activities**: Capture all necessary details without overwhelming the user
- **Understand requirements**: Clear guidance on what information is needed and why
- **Preview results**: See how their activity will appear to potential participants
- **Handle complexity**: Manage advanced features like capacity limits, requirements, and scheduling
- **Recover from errors**: Clear validation and error recovery throughout the process

The creation flow must balance comprehensiveness with simplicity, ensuring high-quality activities while maintaining user engagement.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Complete activity creation workflow design from start to finish
- Form design with progressive disclosure and smart defaults
- Validation and error handling UX patterns
- Activity preview and confirmation interfaces
- Mobile-first responsive design following Funlynk style guide
- Accessibility considerations for diverse user needs

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend API implementation (covered in T02)
- Image upload functionality (covered in T04)
- Template system design (covered in T06)
- Payment integration interfaces (handled by E06)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Activity creation flow achieves 95%+ completion rate
- [ ] Average creation time under 2 minutes for basic activities
