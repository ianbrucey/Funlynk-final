# T02 Activity Management Backend APIs - Problem Definition

## Task Overview

**Task ID**: E03.F01.T02  
**Task Name**: Activity Management Backend APIs  
**Feature**: F01 Activity CRUD Operations  
**Epic**: E03 Activity Management  
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: High (Blocks T03 Frontend Implementation)

## Problem Statement

The Funlynk platform needs robust backend APIs to handle the complete activity lifecycle from creation to deletion. These APIs must support the activity creation UX designed in T01 while providing scalable, secure, and performant operations for activity management.

The backend must handle complex business logic including activity validation, location geocoding, draft management, status transitions, and integration with other platform services (authentication, notifications, geolocation).

## Context & Background

### Business Requirements
- **Activity CRUD**: Complete create, read, update, delete operations
- **Draft Management**: Save and resume incomplete activities
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data validation and business rule enforcement
- **Status Management**: Handle activity lifecycle states (draft, published, cancelled, completed)
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with core infrastructure services
- **Performance**: Support 10,000+ concurrent users with sub-500ms response times

### Technical Context
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with activities table from E01
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration for user verification
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for activity images (handled in T04)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Activity Creation**: Create activities with full validation and enrichment
- [ ] **Activity Retrieval**: Get activities with user-specific context (RSVP status, etc.)
- [ ] **Activity Updates**: Update activities with proper authorization and validation
- [ ] **Activity Deletion**: Soft delete with participant notification
- [ ] **Draft Management**: Save, retrieve, and manage incomplete activities
- [ ] **Status Management**: Handle status transitions with business rule enforcement

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Response Time**: 95% of requests complete within 500ms
- [ ] **Throughput**: Handle 1000+ requests per minute per endpoint
- [ ] **Concurrency**: Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- [ ] **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful error handling
- [ ] **Data Consistency**: ACID compliance for all database operations

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- [ ] **Authorization**: Host-only operations properly restricted
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with appropriate limits
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Sensitive data properly encrypted and protected

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core API Endpoints
1. **POST /api/v1/activities** - Create new activity
2. **GET /api/v1/activities/{id}** - Get activity details
3. **PUT /api/v1/activities/{id}** - Update activity
4. **DELETE /api/v1/activities/{id}** - Delete activity
5. **POST /api/v1/activities/{id}/cancel** - Cancel activity
6. **GET /api/v1/activities/drafts** - Get user drafts
7. **POST /api/v1/activities/drafts** - Save draft
8. **POST /api/v1/activities/validate** - Validate activity data

### Business Logic Implementation
- **Location Validation**: Integrate with geolocation service for address validation
- **Time Validation**: Ensure activities are scheduled for future dates
- **Capacity Validation**: Enforce reasonable capacity limits
- **Host Verification**: Verify host permissions for paid activities
- **Notification Integration**: Trigger notifications for activity events

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Authorization Errors**: Proper HTTP status codes and messages
- **System Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
- **Rate Limiting**: Informative responses when limits exceeded

## Out of Scope

### Excluded from This Task
- Image upload and management (covered in T04)
- Activity editing frontend (covered in T05)
- Template management (covered in T06)
- RSVP operations (covered in F02)
- Payment processing (covered in E06)

### Future Considerations
- Advanced scheduling (recurring events, multi-day activities)
- Collaborative editing with multiple hosts
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external calendar systems

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Tasks
- **E01.F01.T02**: Database schema with activities table
- **E01.F02.T02**: Authentication system APIs
- **E01.F03.T02**: Geolocation service APIs
- **E01.F04.T02**: Notification service APIs

### Dependent Tasks
- **T03**: Frontend implementation depends on API specifications
- **T04**: Image management extends these core APIs
- **T05**: Activity editing uses update APIs
- **F02.T02**: RSVP APIs integrate with activity APIs

### External Dependencies
- Supabase project setup and configuration
- Database migrations from E01 implementation
- Authentication middleware and JWT validation
- Rate limiting and monitoring infrastructure

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Complex Validation**: Balancing comprehensive validation with performance
- **Concurrency**: Handling simultaneous updates to same activity

### Medium Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating with multiple core services
- **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful errors without exposing internals

### Low Risk
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard database operations with established patterns
- **Authentication**: Well-defined Supabase Auth integration
