- [ ] **Display Speed**: Images load within 2 seconds on activity views
- [ ] **Storage Efficiency**: Optimal storage usage with multiple size variants
- [ ] **Bandwidth Optimization**: Progressive loading and adaptive quality

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] **Intuitive Interface**: Clear image management controls
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Upload progress, success, and error states
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Queue uploads when offline, sync when online
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Image Upload Flow
1. **Image Selection** - Native picker with camera/gallery options
2. **Preview & Edit** - Crop, rotate, and basic editing capabilities
3. **Upload Process** - Progressive upload with compression
4. **Status Feedback** - Real-time progress and completion status
5. **Integration** - Seamless integration with activity creation flow

### Image Management Features
- **Reordering**: Drag-and-drop interface for image sequence
- **Captions**: Optional captions for each image
- **Primary Image**: Designate main image for activity cards
- **Deletion**: Remove images with confirmation dialog
- **Replacement**: Replace existing images while maintaining order

### Technical Implementation
- **Client Compression**: Reduce file size before upload
- **Progressive Upload**: Upload in background without blocking UI
- **Error Handling**: Retry failed uploads with exponential backoff
- **Storage Integration**: Supabase Storage with proper bucket organization
- **CDN Optimization**: Automatic CDN distribution for fast global access

### Image Processing Pipeline
```
Original Image â†’ Client Compression â†’ Upload â†’ Server Processing â†’ 
Multiple Sizes (thumbnail, medium, large) â†’ CDN Distribution â†’ Display
```

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Tasks
- **T02**: Backend APIs for activity management
- **T03**: Frontend creation flow implementation
- **E01.F01.T02**: Database schema with activity_images table
- **E01.F01.T05**: Supabase Storage configuration

### Dependent Tasks
- **T05**: Activity editing includes image management
- **T06**: Templates may include default images
- **E04.F01.T03**: Discovery uses images for activity cards

### External Dependencies
- Supabase Storage bucket configuration

## Technical Specifications

### Image Upload Architecture
```typescript
interface ImageUploadService {
  selectImages(): Promise<ImageFile[]>;
  compressImage(image: ImageFile): Promise<CompressedImage>;
  uploadImage(image: CompressedImage, activityId: string): Promise<UploadResult>;
  generateThumbnails(imageUrl: string): Promise<ImageVariants>;
  deleteImage(imageId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Storage Structure
```
activity-images/
â”œâ”€â”€ {activity_id}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ original/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image_2.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ large/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_1_large.webp
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image_2_large.webp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ medium/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_1_medium.webp
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image_2_medium.webp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ thumbnail/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ image_1_thumb.webp
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ image_2_thumb.webp
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE activity_images (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  activity_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  caption TEXT,
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  width INTEGER NOT NULL,
  height INTEGER NOT NULL,
  upload_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'processing',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Upload Failures**: Network issues causing incomplete uploads
- **Storage Costs**: Uncontrolled storage usage with multiple image sizes

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Large images affecting app performance
- **Cross-Platform Differences**: Image handling variations between iOS/Android

### Low Risk
- **Image Quality**: Compression algorithms are well-established
- **Storage Integration**: Supabase Storage provides reliable infrastructure

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: 98%+ successful uploads
- **Compression Ratio**: 70% size reduction on average
- **Upload Speed**: 5 seconds average per image
- **Error Rate**: Less than 2% upload failures

### User Experience Metrics
