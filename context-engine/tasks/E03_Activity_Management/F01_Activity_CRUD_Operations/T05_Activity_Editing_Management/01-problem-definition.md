# T05 Activity Editing & Status Management - Problem Definition

## Task Overview

**Task ID**: E03.F01.T05  
**Task Name**: Activity Editing & Status Management  
**Feature**: F01 Activity CRUD Operations  
**Epic**: E03 Activity Management  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Priority**: Medium (Post-creation functionality)

## Problem Statement

Activity hosts need the ability to modify their activities after creation, manage activity status throughout the lifecycle, and handle cancellations or completions. The editing system must balance flexibility for hosts with stability for participants who have already registered.

The system must handle complex scenarios like editing activities with existing RSVPs, status transitions with proper notifications, and maintaining data integrity while allowing necessary updates.

## Context & Background

### Business Requirements
- **Post-Creation Editing**: Hosts can update activity details after publishing
- **RSVP Impact Management**: Handle edits that affect existing participants
- **Status Lifecycle**: Manage transitions between draft, published, cancelled, completed
- **Participant Notifications**: Notify participants of significant changes
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain consistency when activities are modified
- **Cancellation Handling**: Proper cancellation workflow with refunds and notifications

### Technical Context
- **Existing RSVPs**: Activities may have confirmed participants
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes must propagate to all connected clients
- **Audit Trail**: Track changes for accountability and debugging
- **Business Rules**: Enforce constraints on what can be edited when
- **Integration**: Coordinate with payment, notification, and RSVP systems

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Activity Editing**: Update all activity fields with proper validation
- [ ] **Status Management**: Handle all status transitions with business rules
- [ ] **RSVP Impact Handling**: Manage changes that affect existing participants
- [ ] **Cancellation Workflow**: Complete cancellation process with notifications
- [ ] **Change Notifications**: Notify participants of significant updates
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track all changes with timestamps and reasons

### Business Rule Enforcement
- [ ] **Edit Restrictions**: Prevent disruptive changes to active activities
- [ ] **Capacity Changes**: Handle capacity reductions with existing RSVPs
- [ ] **Time Changes**: Validate time changes and notify participants
- [ ] **Price Changes**: Restrict price changes for activities with paid RSVPs
- [ ] **Location Changes**: Significant location changes require participant consent

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] **Intuitive Interface**: Clear editing interface building on creation UX
- [ ] **Change Preview**: Show impact of changes before applying
- [ ] **Confirmation Dialogs**: Confirm disruptive changes with clear warnings
- [ ] **Error Prevention**: Prevent invalid edits with clear guidance
- [ ] **Quick Actions**: Common actions (cancel, complete) easily accessible

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Editing Features
1. **Edit Activity Details** - Update title, description, requirements, etc.
2. **Modify Schedule** - Change date, time, duration with participant notification
3. **Update Location** - Change venue with impact assessment
4. **Adjust Capacity** - Increase/decrease capacity with RSVP management
5. **Manage Images** - Add, remove, reorder activity images
6. **Update Tags** - Modify tags and categories for better discovery

### Status Management
1. **Publish Draft** - Move draft activities to published status
2. **Cancel Activity** - Cancel with reason, notifications, and refund handling
3. **Complete Activity** - Mark activity as completed with attendance tracking
4. **Unpublish Activity** - Move back to draft (if no RSVPs)

### Advanced Features
- **Bulk Changes**: Apply changes to recurring activities
- **Change History**: View history of all activity modifications
- **Participant Impact**: Show how changes affect existing RSVPs
- **Approval Workflow**: Require approval for significant changes
- **Rollback**: Undo recent changes if needed

### Business Logic Implementation
```typescript
interface EditValidationRules {
  canEditTitle: (activity: Activity) => boolean;
  canChangeTime: (activity: Activity, newTime: Date) => ValidationResult;
  canReduceCapacity: (activity: Activity, newCapacity: number) => ValidationResult;
  canChangePrice: (activity: Activity, newPrice: number) => ValidationResult;
  canChangeLocation: (activity: Activity, newLocation: Location) => ValidationResult;
}
```

## Out of Scope

### Excluded from This Task
- Activity creation interface (covered in T01-T03)
- Image upload functionality (covered in T04)
- Template management (covered in T06)
- RSVP management interface (covered in F02)
- Payment processing and refunds (covered in E06)

### Future Enhancements
- Collaborative editing with multiple hosts
- Advanced approval workflows for changes
- Automated change suggestions based on performance
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Advanced analytics on edit patterns

## Dependencies

### Prerequisite Tasks
- **T01-T03**: Activity creation flow must be complete
- **T04**: Image management for editing image content
- **T02**: Backend APIs must support update operations
- **F02.T02**: RSVP system for impact assessment

### Dependent Tasks
- **T06**: Template system may use editing components
- **E05.T02**: Social features may trigger activity updates
- **E06.T02**: Payment system handles refunds for cancellations

### External Dependencies
- Notification service for participant updates
- Payment service for handling refunds
- Real-time service for live updates
- Audit logging infrastructure

## Technical Specifications

### Edit Validation System
```typescript
interface ActivityEditValidator {
  validateEdit(
    original: Activity, 
    changes: Partial<Activity>
  ): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  
  assessParticipantImpact(
    activity: Activity, 
    changes: Partial<Activity>
  ): Promise<ParticipantImpact>;
  
  enforceBusinessRules(
    activity: Activity, 
    changes: Partial<Activity>
  ): Promise<BusinessRuleResult>;
}
```

### Status Transition Management
```typescript
interface ActivityStatusManager {
  canTransition(from: ActivityStatus, to: ActivityStatus): boolean;
  executeTransition(
    activityId: string, 
    newStatus: ActivityStatus, 
    reason?: string
  ): Promise<TransitionResult>;
  
  handleCancellation(
    activityId: string, 
    reason: string, 
    notifyParticipants: boolean
  ): Promise<CancellationResult>;
}
```

### Change Impact Assessment
```typescript
interface ChangeImpactAssessor {
  assessTimeChange(activity: Activity, newTime: Date): TimeChangeImpact;
  assessLocationChange(activity: Activity, newLocation: Location): LocationChangeImpact;
  assessCapacityChange(activity: Activity, newCapacity: number): CapacityChangeImpact;
  assessPriceChange(activity: Activity, newPrice: number): PriceChangeImpact;
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency when editing activities with RSVPs
- **Participant Disruption**: Changes that negatively impact registered participants

### Medium Risk
- **Complex Business Rules**: Implementing all edit restrictions correctly
- **Notification Complexity**: Ensuring all affected parties are properly notified

### Low Risk
- **UI Implementation**: Building on established creation interface patterns
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Standard database update operations

## User Experience Considerations

### Edit Interface Design
- **Familiar Patterns**: Reuse creation flow components where possible
- **Change Highlighting**: Clearly show what has been modified
- **Impact Warnings**: Alert users to changes that affect participants
- **Save States**: Auto-save drafts, manual save for published activities

### Confirmation Workflows
- **Low Impact Changes**: Save immediately with notification
- **Medium Impact Changes**: Show preview and require confirmation
- **High Impact Changes**: Multi-step confirmation with participant notification

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Clear messages about why edits are not allowed
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits gracefully
- **Recovery Options**: Provide ways to fix or revert problematic changes

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Edit Success Rate**: 95%+ of edit attempts succeed
- **Response Time**: Edit operations complete within 1 second
- **Data Consistency**: Zero data corruption incidents
- **Notification Delivery**: 99%+ of change notifications delivered

### User Experience Metrics
- **Edit Adoption**: 40%+ of activities are edited after creation
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.0+ stars for editing experience
- **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of edits result in user errors
- **Participant Satisfaction**: Minimal complaints about disruptive changes
