# T01 Tagging System UX Design & Category Navigation

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Design the user experience for tag input, selection, and category browsing within the activity creation and discovery flows. This includes creating intuitive interfaces for hosts to tag their activities and for users to navigate and filter activities by categories and tags.

### Problem Statement
Users need an intuitive and efficient way to:
- **Hosts**: Add relevant tags to their activities during creation/editing
- **Attendees**: Browse and filter activities using categories and tags
- **Both**: Discover new activities through trending and suggested tags

The current system lacks a cohesive tagging UX that balances ease of use with discovery power.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tag input component design with autocomplete and suggestions
- Category navigation and browsing interface
- Tag display and interaction patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design following Funlynk style guide
- Accessibility considerations for tag interactions

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend tag management logic (covered in T02)
- Advanced analytics interfaces (covered in T05)
- Search algorithm implementation (handled by E04)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Tag input is intuitive and reduces friction in activity creation
- [ ] Category browsing enables efficient activity discovery
- [ ] Tag suggestions help hosts choose relevant tags
- [ ] Interface follows Funlynk design system and accessibility standards
- [ ] Mobile experience is optimized for touch interactions
- [ ] User testing shows 90%+ task completion rate for tagging flows

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Funlynk design system and style guide
- **Requires**: Activity creation/editing flow designs (from F01)
- **Blocks**: T03 (Frontend implementation needs UX design)
- **Informs**: T02 (UX requirements inform backend API design)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Tag Input Experience
- [ ] Tag input component supports autocomplete with real-time suggestions
- [ ] Users can add tags via typing, selection, or suggested tags
- [ ] Tag validation provides clear feedback for invalid/inappropriate tags
- [ ] Maximum tag limit is clearly communicated and enforced in UI
- [ ] Tag removal is intuitive with clear visual feedback

#### Category Navigation
- [ ] Category hierarchy is visually clear and navigable
- [ ] Users can browse activities by category with filtering options
- [ ] Category selection supports multi-select for broader discovery
- [ ] Popular/trending categories are prominently featured
- [ ] Category descriptions help users understand scope

#### Visual Design
- [ ] Components follow Funlynk design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Tag visual treatment is consistent across all contexts
- [ ] Interactive states (hover, focus, selected) are clearly defined
- [ ] Loading and error states are designed and documented
- [ ] Responsive behavior is defined for all screen sizes

#### Accessibility
- [ ] All interactive elements meet minimum touch target size (44px)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation is fully supported
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and consistent

### Estimated Effort
**3-4 hours** for experienced UX designer

### Task Breakdown
1. **Research & Analysis** (45 minutes)
   - Review existing tag UX patterns from similar platforms
   - Analyze Funlynk user flows for integration points
   - Study accessibility requirements for tag interfaces

2. **Wireframe Creation** (90 minutes)
   - Tag input component wireframes
   - Category navigation layouts
   - Activity filtering interfaces
   - Mobile and desktop responsive layouts

3. **Visual Design** (90 minutes)
   - Apply Funlynk design system to wireframes
   - Create component variations and states
   - Design tag visual treatments and interactions
   - Document spacing, colors, and typography

4. **Documentation & Handoff** (30 minutes)
   - Create design specifications document
   - Document interaction patterns and behaviors
   - Prepare assets for development handoff

### Deliverables
- [ ] Tag input component wireframes and designs
- [ ] Category navigation interface designs
- [ ] Tag display and interaction pattern documentation
- [ ] Responsive design specifications
- [ ] Accessibility compliance documentation
- [ ] Design system component specifications
- [ ] Developer handoff documentation with assets

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Designs follow Funlynk brand guidelines and style guide
- [ ] All interactive states are defined and documented
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive approach is implemented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met and documented
- [ ] User flow integration points are clearly defined
- [ ] Component reusability is considered and documented
