# T02 Tag Management Backend APIs & Intelligence

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Implement comprehensive backend services for tag management including CRUD operations, intelligent tag suggestions, validation, and analytics tracking. This forms the core API layer that powers all tagging functionality across the platform.

### Problem Statement
The platform needs robust backend services to:
- **Manage tag lifecycle**: Create, read, update, delete tags with proper validation
- **Provide intelligent suggestions**: Offer relevant tag suggestions based on activity content and context
- **Ensure data quality**: Validate tags, prevent spam, and maintain tag consistency
- **Track usage analytics**: Monitor tag popularity and usage patterns for trending analysis
- **Support discovery**: Provide efficient APIs for tag-based activity filtering and search

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tag CRUD API endpoints with validation and error handling
- Tag suggestion engine with content analysis and popularity weighting
- Tag validation system with spam prevention and content moderation
- Tag analytics tracking for usage patterns and trending identification
- Activity-tag relationship management APIs
- Tag search and autocomplete endpoints

**Out of Scope:**
- Frontend tag components (covered in T03)
- Category hierarchy management (covered in T04)
- Advanced machine learning classification (covered in T06)
- Real-time analytics dashboards (handled by E07)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tag operations complete in under 200ms
- [ ] Tag suggestions achieve 80%+ acceptance rate in user testing
- [ ] API endpoints handle 1000+ concurrent requests efficiently
- [ ] Tag validation prevents 95%+ of spam/inappropriate content
- [ ] System scales to support 10,000+ unique tags
- [ ] Analytics tracking captures all necessary metrics for trending analysis

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: E01.F01 Database schema with tags and activity_tags tables
- **Requires**: Activity management APIs (from F01) for content analysis
- **Blocks**: T03 (Frontend needs backend APIs)
- **Blocks**: T05 (Analytics needs tracking infrastructure)
- **Informs**: T04 (Category management builds on tag infrastructure)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Tag CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create tag endpoint with validation and duplicate prevention
- [ ] Read tag endpoint with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- [ ] Update tag endpoint with proper authorization and audit logging
- [ ] Delete tag endpoint with cascade handling for activity relationships
- [ ] Bulk operations support for efficient tag management

#### Tag Suggestion Engine
- [ ] Content-based suggestions analyze activity title, description, and location
- [ ] Popularity-based suggestions weight frequently used relevant tags
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions consider user's past tagging behavior
- [ ] Real-time suggestion API responds in under 100ms
- [ ] Suggestion quality improves over time with usage feedback

#### Tag Validation System
- [ ] Length validation (3-30 characters) with clear error messages
- [ ] Content validation prevents profanity, spam, and inappropriate tags
- [ ] Duplicate detection with case-insensitive and similarity matching
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents tag spam from individual users
- [ ] Moderation queue for flagged or suspicious tags

#### Activity-Tag Relationships
- [ ] Associate tags with activities with proper foreign key constraints
- [ ] Support tag limits per activity (maximum 10 tags)
- [ ] Efficient queries for activities by tag with performance optimization
- [ ] Tag removal handling when activities are deleted
- [ ] Bulk tag operations for activity management

#### Analytics & Tracking
- [ ] Tag usage tracking with timestamps and user context
- [ ] Tag popularity metrics calculation and caching
- [ ] Trending tag identification with time-based weighting
- [ ] Tag performance analytics for suggestion engine improvement
- [ ] Usage pattern analysis for content moderation

2. **Core Tag Management** (90 minutes)
   - Implement tag CRUD operations with Supabase
   - Add validation logic and error handling
   - Create activity-tag relationship management
   - Implement tag search and autocomplete

3. **Intelligent Suggestion Engine** (60 minutes)
   - Build content analysis for tag suggestions
   - Implement popularity-based suggestion weighting
   - Create real-time suggestion API endpoint
   - Add suggestion feedback tracking

4. **Analytics & Validation** (30 minutes)
   - Implement tag usage tracking
   - Add spam prevention and content validation
   - Create trending tag calculation logic
   - Set up performance monitoring

### Deliverables
- [ ] Tag management API endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Tag suggestion engine with content analysis
- [ ] Tag validation and spam prevention system
- [ ] Activity-tag relationship management APIs
- [ ] Tag analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Database migration scripts for tag-related tables
- [ ] Unit tests with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization documentation

### Technical Specifications

#### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Tags table (if not exists from E01.F01)
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  slug VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_trending BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Activity-Tag relationships
CREATE TABLE activity_tags (
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id UUID REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (activity_id, tag_id)
);

-- Tag usage analytics
CREATE TABLE tag_usage_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tag_id UUID REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'created', 'suggested', 'accepted', 'removed'
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tags` - List tags with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/tags` - Create new tag with validation
- `GET /api/tags/:id` - Get specific tag details
- `PUT /api/tags/:id` - Update tag (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/tags/:id` - Delete tag (admin only)
- `GET /api/tags/suggestions` - Get tag suggestions for content
- `GET /api/tags/trending` - Get trending tags
- `GET /api/tags/search` - Search/autocomplete tags
- `POST /api/activities/:id/tags` - Add tags to activity
- `DELETE /api/activities/:id/tags/:tagId` - Remove tag from activity

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Input validation prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks
- [ ] Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- [ ] Audit logging for all tag management operations
- [ ] Unit tests cover all business logic and edge cases
