# T03 Tag Input & Suggestion Frontend Components

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Implement React Native components for tag input, selection, and suggestion functionality. This includes creating reusable components that provide an intuitive tagging experience for activity creation and editing, following the UX designs and integrating with backend APIs.

### Problem Statement
Users need responsive, intuitive frontend components that:
- **Enable efficient tag input**: Allow hosts to quickly add relevant tags to activities
- **Provide intelligent suggestions**: Surface relevant tag suggestions based on content and popularity
- **Support tag management**: Enable easy addition, removal, and editing of tags
- **Ensure accessibility**: Work seamlessly with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Maintain performance**: Handle large tag datasets without UI lag

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Tag input component with autocomplete and real-time suggestions
- Tag suggestion display with acceptance/rejection interactions
- Tag display and management components for activity forms
- Integration with backend tag APIs for suggestions and validation
- Accessibility features and keyboard navigation support
- Error handling and loading states

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend API implementation (covered in T02)
- Category browsing interfaces (covered in T04)
- Advanced analytics tracking (covered in T05)
- Tag moderation interfaces (handled by E07)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Tag input provides smooth, responsive user experience
- [ ] Tag suggestions achieve 80%+ acceptance rate in user testing
- [ ] Components follow Funlynk design system consistently
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met with full keyboard navigation
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with 1000+ tags in suggestion list
- [ ] Error states provide clear, actionable feedback to users

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: T01 UX designs and component specifications
- **Requires**: T02 Backend APIs for tag operations and suggestions
- **Requires**: Activity creation/editing components (from F01)
- **Blocks**: Integration testing and user acceptance testing
- **Informs**: T05 Analytics (frontend tracking events)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Tag Input Component
- [ ] Real-time autocomplete with debounced API calls (300ms delay)
- [ ] Support for keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
- [ ] Visual feedback for valid/invalid tag input
- [ ] Maximum tag limit enforcement with clear messaging
- [ ] Tag deduplication with case-insensitive matching

#### Tag Suggestion System
- [ ] Display relevant suggestions based on activity content
- [ ] One-tap/click tag acceptance from suggestions
- [ ] Suggestion dismissal without adding to activity
- [ ] Loading states during suggestion fetching
- [ ] Fallback behavior when suggestions fail to load

#### Tag Display & Management
- [ ] Visual tag chips with consistent styling
- [ ] Easy tag removal with confirmation for bulk operations
- [ ] Tag reordering support for host preference
- [ ] Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy between selected and suggested tags

#### Integration & Performance
- [ ] Seamless integration with activity creation/editing forms
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates with rollback on API failures
- [ ] Efficient re-rendering with proper React optimization
- [ ] Offline support with local caching of recent tags
- [ ] Error boundary implementation for graceful failure handling

#### Accessibility Features
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation support
- [ ] Focus management for complex interactions
- [ ] High contrast mode compatibility
- [ ] Voice control support where applicable

### Estimated Effort

   - Create component composition strategy

2. **Core Tag Input Implementation** (90 minutes)
   - Build tag input component with autocomplete
   - Implement real-time suggestion fetching
   - Add tag validation and error handling
   - Create tag display and removal functionality

3. **Suggestion & Interaction Features** (60 minutes)
   - Implement suggestion display and selection
   - Add keyboard navigation and accessibility
   - Create loading and error states
   - Optimize performance for large datasets

4. **Integration & Testing** (30 minutes)
   - Integrate with activity creation forms
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement offline support and caching
   - Create unit tests for component logic

### Deliverables
- [ ] TagInput component with autocomplete functionality
- [ ] TagSuggestions component with selection interactions
- [ ] TagChip component for tag display and removal
- [ ] TagManager component for bulk tag operations
- [ ] Integration hooks for activity form integration
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces and prop definitions
- [ ] Component documentation with usage examples
- [ ] Unit tests with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Accessibility testing results and compliance documentation

### Technical Specifications

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Core tag input component
interface TagInputProps {
  value: Tag[];
  onChange: (tags: Tag[]) => void;
  maxTags?: number;
  placeholder?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  activityContext?: ActivityContext;
  onSuggestionAccepted?: (tag: Tag) => void;
}

// Tag suggestion component
interface TagSuggestionsProps {
  suggestions: Tag[];
  onAccept: (tag: Tag) => void;
  onDismiss: (tag: Tag) => void;
  loading?: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

// Individual tag display
interface TagChipProps {
  tag: Tag;
  onRemove?: (tag: Tag) => void;
  variant?: 'selected' | 'suggested' | 'trending';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

#### State Management
```typescript
interface TagInputState {
  inputValue: string;
  selectedTags: Tag[];
  suggestions: Tag[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  showSuggestions: boolean;
}

// Custom hook for tag management
const useTagInput = (initialTags: Tag[], maxTags: number) => {
  // Tag selection logic
  // Suggestion fetching
  // Validation and error handling
  // API integration
};
```

#### API Integration
- Debounced suggestion fetching with AbortController
- Optimistic updates for tag operations
- Error handling with retry logic
- Offline caching with AsyncStorage
- Performance monitoring for API calls

#### Styling & Theming
