# T04 Category Hierarchy & Management System

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Implement a hierarchical category system that organizes activities into logical groups, enabling efficient browsing and discovery. This includes both backend category management and frontend category navigation interfaces that work seamlessly with the tagging system.

### Problem Statement
Users need a structured way to:
- **Browse activities by category**: Navigate through organized activity types (Sports â†’ Basketball, Arts â†’ Music â†’ Jazz)
- **Understand activity context**: Categories provide immediate context about activity type and audience
- **Discover new interests**: Hierarchical browsing helps users explore related activities
- **Filter efficiently**: Combine category and tag filtering for precise activity discovery

The platform needs a flexible category system that balances organization with discoverability.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Hierarchical category database schema (3 levels maximum)
- Category CRUD operations with parent-child relationship management
- Category browsing interface with navigation and filtering
- Activity-category assignment and management
- Category popularity tracking and trending categories
- Admin interface for category management and moderation

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced category analytics dashboards (handled by E07)
- Machine learning category suggestions (covered in T06)
- Category-based recommendation algorithms (handled by E04)
- Social category features like user-created categories

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Category hierarchy supports 3 levels of nesting efficiently
- [ ] Category browsing enables 90%+ task completion for activity discovery
- [ ] Category assignment reduces activity creation time by 30%
- [ ] System scales to support 500+ categories across all levels
- [ ] Category navigation loads in under 300ms on mobile devices
- [ ] Admin category management is intuitive and efficient

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: T02 Tag management infrastructure for integration
- **Requires**: Activity management system (from F01) for category assignment
- **Requires**: T01 UX designs for category navigation interfaces
- **Blocks**: E04 Discovery engine category-based filtering
- **Informs**: T05 Analytics system for category usage tracking

### Technical Specifications

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Categories table with hierarchy support
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  icon_url VARCHAR(255),
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  level INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK (level <= 3),
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  activity_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Activity-Category relationships
CREATE TABLE activity_categories (
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (activity_id, category_id)
);

-- Category usage analytics
CREATE TABLE category_usage_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'viewed', 'selected', 'filtered'
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/categories` - List categories with hierarchy
- `POST /api/categories` - Create new category (admin)
- `GET /api/categories/:id` - Get category details with children
- `PUT /api/categories/:id` - Update category (admin)
- `DELETE /api/categories/:id` - Delete category (admin)
- `GET /api/categories/tree` - Get full category tree
- `GET /api/categories/popular` - Get popular categories
- `POST /api/activities/:id/categories` - Assign categories to activity
- `GET /api/activities/by-category/:categoryId` - Get activities by category

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Category browser component
interface CategoryBrowserProps {
  onCategorySelect: (category: Category) => void;
  selectedCategories?: Category[];
  showHierarchy?: boolean;
  maxSelections?: number;
}

// Category navigation component
interface CategoryNavigationProps {
  currentCategory?: Category;
  onNavigate: (category: Category) => void;
  showBreadcrumbs?: boolean;
  showActivityCount?: boolean;
}

// Category selector for forms
interface CategorySelectorProps {
  value: Category[];
  onChange: (categories: Category[]) => void;
