# T06 Activity Classification & Auto-tagging

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Implement intelligent activity classification and automatic tag suggestion system that analyzes activity content (title, description, location, time) to automatically suggest relevant tags and categories. This reduces host effort while improving tag consistency and discoverability across the platform.

### Problem Statement
Activity hosts need assistance with:
- **Consistent tagging**: Many hosts struggle to choose appropriate tags, leading to inconsistent categorization
- **Tag discovery**: Hosts may not know all relevant tags that could improve their activity's discoverability
- **Time efficiency**: Manual tagging takes time and effort that could be better spent on activity planning
- **Quality improvement**: Automated suggestions can improve overall tag quality and platform searchability

The system needs to balance automation with host control, providing helpful suggestions without being intrusive.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Content analysis algorithms for activity text and metadata
- Machine learning-based tag suggestion using existing platform data
- Rule-based classification for common activity patterns
- Confidence scoring for auto-suggested tags
- Integration with activity creation/editing workflows
- Feedback loop for improving suggestion accuracy over time

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced NLP models requiring external APIs (cost optimization for MVP)
- Image analysis for activity photos (future enhancement)
- Real-time learning during user sessions (batch processing approach)
- Multi-language support (English-first for MVP)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Auto-tagging suggestions achieve 85%+ relevance accuracy
- [ ] 70%+ of hosts accept at least one auto-suggested tag
- [ ] Auto-tagging reduces average activity creation time by 30%
- [ ] System processes activity content in under 500ms
- [ ] Suggestion quality improves 20%+ over 3 months with feedback
- [ ] False positive rate stays below 15% for suggested tags

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: T02 Tag management APIs and tag database
- **Requires**: T05 Analytics system for feedback and improvement data
- **Requires**: Activity management system (from F01) for content access
- **Requires**: T04 Category system for classification context
- **Blocks**: Enhanced activity creation UX with intelligent suggestions
- **Informs**: E04 Discovery engine with improved content classification
