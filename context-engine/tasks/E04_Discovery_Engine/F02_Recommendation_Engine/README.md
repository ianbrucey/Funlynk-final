# F02 Recommendation Engine - Feature Overview

## Feature Purpose

This feature provides personalized activity recommendations using multiple data sources including user interests, behavior patterns, social connections, and collaborative filtering. It enables users to discover relevant activities through intelligent recommendations that improve over time.

## Feature Scope

### In Scope
- Interest-based activity matching using user profiles and preferences
- Collaborative filtering based on similar user behavior patterns
- Social influence recommendations from friends and connections
- Trending activity recommendations based on platform-wide data
- Real-time recommendation updates based on user interactions
- Recommendation explanation and transparency features
- A/B testing framework for recommendation algorithm improvements

### Out of Scope
- Basic user profile management (handled by E02)
- Activity creation and management (handled by E03)
- Social connection management (handled by E05)
- Payment-related recommendations (handled by E06)
