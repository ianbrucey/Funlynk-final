# T01 Social Sharing UX Design & Viral Mechanics

## Problem Definition

### Task Overview
Design comprehensive user experience for social sharing and viral growth mechanics including external platform sharing, internal recommendation sharing, reaction systems, and social proof indicators. This includes creating sharing interfaces that maximize viral potential while maintaining user trust and platform quality.

### Problem Statement
Users need intuitive, compelling sharing experiences that:
- **Encourage viral sharing**: Make sharing activities feel natural and rewarding
- **Provide multiple sharing options**: Support various sharing contexts and platforms
- **Build social proof**: Show social engagement to encourage participation
- **Maintain authenticity**: Ensure shared content feels genuine and trustworthy
- **Drive growth**: Convert shared content into new user acquisition and engagement

The sharing system must balance viral growth potential with user experience quality and platform integrity.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- External social platform sharing interface design
- Internal activity sharing and recommendation design
- Multi-type reaction system interface design
- Social proof indicator design and placement
- Save/bookmark interface with collections
