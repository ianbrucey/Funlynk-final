# Task Breakdown Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for breaking down our 7 completed epics into actionable features and tasks for implementation. We'll use our enhanced task templates to create detailed, implementable work items.

## Epic to Feature to Task Hierarchy

### Epic Planning âœ… COMPLETE
- **E01-E07**: All epics fully planned with architecture, APIs, and integration points

### Feature Planning ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE
- Break each epic into 3-5 major features
- Each feature represents a cohesive user-facing capability
- Features should be implementable in 1-2 weeks by a small team

### Task Planning ðŸ”„ FOLLOWING PHASE  
- Break each feature into 5-10 granular tasks
- Each task should take 1-4 hours for a professional developer
- Tasks follow our enhanced template structure (UX â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend â†’ Third-party)

## Task Creation Guidelines

### Task Granularity
- **1-4 hours** for experienced developer
- **Single responsibility** - one clear objective
- **Testable outcome** - clear definition of done
- **Minimal dependencies** - can be worked on independently when possible

### Task Template Structure
Each task will use our enhanced template with:
1. **Problem Definition** - Clear problem statement and context
2. **Research** - Technical research and decision points
3. **Planning** - Detailed UX, Backend, Frontend, Third-party specifications
4. **Implementation** - Step-by-step implementation tracking

### Task Naming Convention
- **Epic.Feature.Task** format (e.g., E01.F01.T01)
- **Descriptive names** that clearly indicate the work
- **Component prefix** when applicable (UX-, BE-, FE-, TP-)

## Feature Breakdown Examples

### E01.F01 Database Foundation
- **E01.F01.T01** - Set up Supabase project and basic configuration
- **E01.F01.T02** - Create core database schema (users, profiles, activities)
- **E01.F01.T03** - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **E01.F01.T04** - Set up database migrations and version control
- **E01.F01.T05** - Create database backup and recovery procedures

### E02.F01 User Registration & Onboarding  
- **E02.F01.T01** - Design user registration UX flow
- **E02.F01.T02** - Implement backend user registration API
- **E02.F01.T03** - Build frontend registration forms
- **E02.F01.T04** - Integrate email verification system
- **E02.F01.T05** - Create onboarding tutorial and welcome flow

### E03.F01 Activity CRUD Operations
- **E03.F01.T01** - Design activity creation UX workflow
- **E03.F01.T02** - Implement backend activity management APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Start with E01.F01 Database Foundation** - Create detailed tasks
2. **Follow dependency order** - Ensure prerequisites are completed first
3. **Use enhanced templates** - Maintain consistency and quality
4. **Track progress** - Update task status and learnings
5. **Iterate and improve** - Refine task breakdown based on implementation experience

## Success Criteria

- **Clear implementation path** from epic to feature to task
- **Manageable task sizes** that fit within development sprints
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all planned epic functionality
- **Dependency awareness** to prevent blocking issues
- **Quality standards** maintained through template usage

---

**Status**: Ready to begin feature and task creation
**Next Action**: Create E01.F01 Database Foundation feature tasks
**Priority**: Start with highest dependency features first
