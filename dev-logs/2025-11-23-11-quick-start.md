## 📚 Key Documentation to Read

**Before Starting**:
1. `context-engine/epics/E04_Discovery_Engine/epic-overview.md`
2. `context-engine/epics/E04_Discovery_Engine/posts-vs-events-architecture.md`
3. `context-engine/tasks/E04_Discovery_Engine/README.md`

**For UI Work (Agent A)**:
- `context-engine/domain-contexts/ui-design-standards.md`
- `resources/views/livewire/activities/activity-detail.blade.php` (example)

**For Database Work (Agent C)**:
- `context-engine/domain-contexts/database-context.md`
- `context-engine/epics/E01_Core_Infrastructure/database-schema.md`

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

**Agent C → Agent B**:
- Agent B uses Agent C's models (Post, PostReaction, PostConversion)
- Agent B queries Agent C's database tables

**Agent B → Agent A**:
- Agent A calls Agent B's services (FeedService, PostService)
- Agent A displays data from Agent B's methods

**Agent A ↔ Agent C**:
- Agent A uses Agent C's models in Livewire components
- Agent A displays Agent C's model data in views

---

## 💬 Communication

**Daily Updates**:
- Update your dev log with progress
- Flag blockers immediately
- Share completed work for integration

**Integration Testing**:
- Agent C: Notify when models are ready
- Agent B: Notify when services are ready
- Agent A: Notify when UI is ready for testing

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Posts vs Events Differences**

| Feature | Posts | Events |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Lifespan** | 24-48h (ephemeral) | Persistent |
| **Discovery Radius** | 5-10km | 25-50km |
| **Interactions** | Reactions ("I'm down", "Join me") | RSVPs |
| **Conversion** | Can evolve into Events | Cannot convert back |
| **Styling** | Casual, compact, gradient borders | Formal, larger, structured |

### **Conversion Thresholds**
- **5+ reactions**: Suggest conversion to host
- **10+ reactions**: Auto-convert to Event

### **Galaxy Theme**
- All UI must follow galaxy theme (glass cards, gradients, aurora)
- Mobile: Edge-to-edge, square corners
- Desktop: Rounded corners, proper padding
