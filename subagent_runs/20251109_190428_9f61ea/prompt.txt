You are rebuilding F01 Database Foundation task documentation for a Laravel 12 + Filament v4 project.

CONTEXT:
- Project: FunLynk - spontaneous social discovery platform
- Stack: Laravel 12, Filament v4, Livewire v3, PostGIS, Pest v4
- Architecture: Posts vs Events dual model (Posts = ephemeral 24-48h content, Events = structured activities)

INPUT FILES TO READ:
1. context-engine/epics/E01_Core_Infrastructure/epic-overview.md
2. context-engine/epics/E01_Core_Infrastructure/database-schema.md
3. context-engine/tasks/E01_Core_Infrastructure/F01_Database_Foundation/README.md

TASK:
Rewrite the F01 Database Foundation feature documentation to reflect Laravel approach instead of React Native/Supabase approach.

KEY CHANGES NEEDED:
1. Replace Supabase SQL scripts with Laravel migrations
2. Remove RLS policies (Laravel uses middleware/policies instead)
3. Add Posts tables (posts, post_reactions, post_conversions) from epic schema
4. Update activities table with post conversion fields
5. Focus on Laravel migrations, Eloquent models, and Filament resources
6. Update task breakdown to use Laravel Artisan commands
7. Reference PostGIS setup for Laravel (not Supabase)
8. Update time estimates for Laravel approach

STRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN:
- Keep the README.md format
- Keep the 6 tasks (T01-T06) structure
- Update task descriptions for Laravel
- Keep success criteria (update for Laravel context)
- Keep dependencies section

OUTPUT:
Save the updated documentation to: context-engine/tasks/E01_Core_Infrastructure/F01_Database_Foundation/README.md

VALIDATION:
- Ensure all references to Supabase client SDK are removed
- Ensure all references to RLS policies are removed or replaced with Laravel policies
- Ensure Posts vs Events model is reflected in schema
- Ensure Laravel 12 best practices are followed
- Ensure file is valid Markdown
