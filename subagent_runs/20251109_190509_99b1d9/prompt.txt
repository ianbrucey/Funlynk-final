You are rebuilding F03 Geolocation Services task documentation for a Laravel 12 + Filament v4 project.

CONTEXT:
- Project: FunLynk - spontaneous social discovery platform
- Stack: Laravel 12, Filament v4, PostGIS, Livewire v3
- Architecture: Posts vs Events dual model (Posts = tighter radius 5-10km, Events = wider radius 25-50km)

INPUT FILES TO READ:
1. context-engine/epics/E01_Core_Infrastructure/epic-overview.md
2. context-engine/epics/E01_Core_Infrastructure/database-schema.md
3. context-engine/tasks/E01_Core_Infrastructure/F03_Geolocation_Services/README.md

TASK:
Rewrite the F03 Geolocation Services feature documentation to reflect Laravel + PostGIS approach instead of React Native/Supabase approach.

KEY CHANGES NEEDED:
1. Focus on PostGIS setup for Laravel
2. Remove React Native map component references
3. Add Laravel service classes for geolocation
4. Update geocoding to use Laravel HTTP client with Google Maps API
5. Reference both Posts and Events proximity search (different radii)
6. Update map integration for web (Leaflet/Mapbox)
7. Focus on Laravel Eloquent spatial queries
8. Update time estimates for Laravel approach

STRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN:
- Keep the README.md format
- Keep the 5 tasks (T01-T05) structure
- Update task descriptions for Laravel
- Keep success criteria (update for Laravel context)
- Keep dependencies section

OUTPUT:
Save the updated documentation to: context-engine/tasks/E01_Core_Infrastructure/F03_Geolocation_Services/README.md

VALIDATION:
- Ensure PostGIS setup is for Laravel
- Ensure all React Native references are removed
- Ensure Posts vs Events different radii are mentioned
- Ensure Laravel service class patterns are used
- Ensure file is valid Markdown
